<div class="post-content">
<p>I’ve heard plenty of times on the <a href="http://lists.ironpython.com/pipermail/users-ironpython.com/2009-November/011606.html" target="_blank">IronPython Mailing List</a> that embedding IronPython in Silverlight is easy at first, but then you fall off a cliff when trying to import, be it from a .NET namespace, the Python built-ins, or even other Python files. Let me clear some things up, and fix some code in the process.</p>  <h4><font color="#ff8000">Slight detour – Embedding in Silverlight 101</font></h4>  <p>First off, Michael Foord has an article on his website about <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/ironpython/silverlight/embedding_ironpython.shtml" target="_blank">Embedding IronPython in Silverlight</a>, which still works. However, that’s a ton of complicated code, all having to do with creating a <code>ScriptRuntime</code> instance correctly configured for Silverlight. To make this much less verbose, <code>DynamicEngine.CreateRuntime</code> (in the <code>Microsoft.Scripting.Silverlight </code>namespace) will create a <code>ScriptRuntime</code> all prepped for use in Silverlight; this significantly reduces the boilerplate hosting code:</p> <script src="http://gist.github.com/231540.js"></script>  <p>In case you need to customize your <code>ScriptRuntime</code>, the <code>DynamicEngine.CreateRuntimeSetup</code> method is there to create a <code>ScriptRuntimeSetup</code> object configured for Silverlight, which then you can tweak things as necessary and create your own <code>ScriptRuntime</code>.</p> <script src="http://gist.github.com/231772.js"></script>  <p><em>Note: The IronPython sources currently are <strong>broken</strong> for embedding, but in the next few days the sources should reflect what this post shows.</em></p>  <h4><font color="#ff8000">Testing that "import" works</font></h4>  <p>Ok, great, the boilerplate hosting code doesn’t need to look hideous, but let’s get back on track.</p>  <p><a href="http://jimmy.schementi.com/silverlight/embedding-ipy" target="_blank"><img style="display: block; float: none; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto" title="Embedding IronPython in Silverlight - Importing test" alt="Embedding IronPython in Silverlight - Importing test" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/Svp-TQ-aWJI/AAAAAAAAANM/t4O3o71LlG4/ipy-sl-embed-import-test%5B7%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="400" height="260" /></a></p>  <p align="center"><a href="http://jimmy.schementi.com/silverlight/embedding-ipy" target="_blank">Embedding IronPython in Silverlight – importing test</a> (<a href="http://github.com/jschementi/orphanage/tree/master/embedding-ipy/" target="_blank">sources</a>)</p>  <p>Here’s a quick test of IronPython’s ability to import various modules in Silverlight, testing this exact code works while being embedded:</p> <script src="http://gist.github.com/231783.js"></script>  <p>None of these worked when I first wrote the tests, since there was an exception being thrown in the XAP-virtual-filesystem, <a href="http://lists.ironpython.com/pipermail/users-ironpython.com/2009-November/011606.html" target="_blank">reported yesterday on the IronPython mailing list</a>. But with that fixed, the <code>import bar.baz</code> case still failed:</p>  <pre style="background-color: #333; color: white; padding: 5px;">[FAIL]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  at test_import in foo.py, line 5
ImportError: No module named bar.baz</pre>

<p>Here's the layout of the Python files in the XAP</p>

<pre style="background-color: #333; color: white; padding: 5px;">foo.py
bar/
bar/__init__.py
bar/baz.py</pre>

<p><code>Application.GetResourceStream(&quot;bar/__init__.py&quot;)</code> was returning <code>null</code>, though <code>bar/__init__.py</code> was definitely inside the XAP. However, <code>bar/__init__.py</code> was empty, and it turns out that <code>Application.GetResourceStream</code> returns <code>null</code> if the file is empty as well as if it doesn’t exist! Putting a single space in <code>bar/__init__.py</code> (or anything that will make the file not empty … I suggest a comment) causes it to be found, and then <code>bar/baz.py</code> can be imported properly.</p>

<p>So, moral of the story:<br /><font color="#ff8000"><strong>“an empty file in the XAP is a non-existent file!”</strong></font></p>

<p>Anyway, I hope that clears up some of the issues most people initially face with embedding IronPython in Silverlight. Let me know if there are any more issues.</p>

<p><em>Note: As I said before, the current IronPython sources are broken for embedding, but in the next few days the sources should reflect what this post shows. <a href="http://github.com/jschementi/orphanage/tree/master/embedding-ipy/Dependencies/" target="_blank">If you’re impatient, grab these binaries</a>.</em></p>
