Intrigued by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Language_Runtime">DLR</a>, <a href="http://labs.live.com/volta/">Volta</a>, or other Microsoft language technology? Want to find out how others are implementing languages in browsers, *nix platforms, or <a href="http://jruby.codehaus.org/">Java</a>?

Yes? Great, sounds like you'll love Lang.NET! January 28-30. Microsoft Redmond Campus.

Lang.NET focuses on the things you care about; designing, implementing, and building tools around languages. We'll have talks from developers doing all sorts of language-related work, and most won't be from Microsoft employees. This is the second Lang.NET Microsoft is sponsoring, after a great turnout at the first Lang.NET in the summer of 2006. <a href="http://langnetsymposium.com/">http://langnetsymposium.com</a> has more verb-age on exactly what Lang.NET is.

<strike>The speakers and agenda are still being worked out, but I'll let you know when they are available on the website (later this week).</strike> All the information is available on the website.
