TechReady 3 was this past week. I was there as a speaker, giving a break-out
session about Dynamic Languages in ASP.NET with David Ebbo, and Architect I
work with. Overall the event was great and our talk went well, but let me give
a brief overview of my day.
</p>

<p>
After that we had a lot of time to kill even before the talk we were going to
before ours, so we walked around the convention center. The company store was
selling t-shirts and such, there was a "Vista Lounge" set up with Vista
machines for the playing, and tons of other stuff. Oh, and there was more
coffee!
</p>

<p>
So when  we arrived  and checked-in and whatnot, the first course of action was
to prepare the demos! After that, the next priority was obviously food. And soo
much food! I had too much coffee, let's just say that :)
</p>

<p>
Anyway, the talk David and I went to was on Blinq; a way to auto-generate CRUD
functionality in ASP.NET applications. It's amazing how close it was to doing
what we are doing, but in a completely different way. Blinq does code
generation at design-time, so like a wizard, and provides the developer with a
bunch of C# classes that give them programmable access to their data layer.
But, what if you change your database? Yes, that means you need to regenerate
that data layer ... and if you have manually changed your data layer ... you're
screwed ... those changes are gone. Blinq is build on-top on LINQ, which stands
for "Language INtegrated Query". Basically it's an extension to C# to build
queries right into the language. It's very cool!

<p>
So our talk, "Developing ASP.NET Web Applications using Dynamic Languages", was
about just that, but specifically demoing ASP.NET using <a
href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython">IronPython</a>, Microsoft's new
Python implementation. This project is currently codenamed "Project Merlin",
but expect that to change. The goal of web-side of Project Merlin is to bring
choice to ASP.NET and let developers who prefer dynamic languages to develop on
ASP.NET. While we don't want to change ASP.NET, we want to make it inviting to
dynamic language developers. We demoed some sample applications in IronPython
ASP.NET, and then showed a completely different demo on how we'd like to make
the data story for dynamic languages much more, well, dynamic! Essentially we
had the same thing as Blinq, but dynamically generated at runtime and with no
on-disk code generation. Then you can customize each table by throwing a Python
file at it, and given some convention of method naming, customize the output.
When the recording/slides are avaliable ... and if I can post them here ... I
will.

So overall we felt the talk went very well; people seemed to like what they
heard/saw, and the questions after were very cool. The reviews were excellent,
but the one point that stood out to me ... people wanted to hear to "Why should
I use Dynamic Languages" speech. Though I wanted to avoid that discussion, is
seems like it's necessary to have whenever you're talking to the non-dynlan
crowd. Other than that, it was fun!
