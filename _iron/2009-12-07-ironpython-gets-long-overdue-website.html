<div class="post-content">
<p align="left">In preparation for the <a href="http://ironpython.net/download/" target="_blank">final IronPython 2.6 release</a>, the project finally gets a nice homepage: <a href="http://ironpython.net" target="_blank"><strong>IronPython.net</strong></a>!</p>  <p><a href="http://ironpython.net" target="_blank"><img style="display: inline" title="image" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/Sx1zp94rEZI/AAAAAAAAANU/O9hFVBdxEBQ/image%5B7%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="400" height="253" /></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com" target="_blank">CodePlex</a> will continue to be the tool we use for project management and releases, but all end-user information will be on <a href="http://ironpython.net" target="_blank">IronPython.net</a>. Also, the .com domain still points at the super-old site, but will redirect to this site shortly.</p>  <p>The most notably addition is the <a href="http://ironpython.net/documentation/dotnet/" target="_blank">.NET Integration Documentation</a>, a thorough set of examples and descriptions of using IronPython with .NET. Considering this is IronPython’s main purpose, it’s amazing we got away with having hardly no documentation for this long … I guess the .NET integration is just that intuitive :) Anyway, please give it a read and let us know if you have any suggestions.</p>  <h4><font color="#ff8000">There’s a ton left to do!</font></h4>  <p>This site is very much a shell of what it could be, and I’d love for the IronPython community to help out here. Here are a few things I’d like to add to the site in the very near future; please let me know if you’d lie to help out, or have other ideas:</p>  <ul>   <li><em><strong>Who’s using IronPython?</strong></em> A list of companies, public websites, and any type of application which use IronPython, in any way, would be a great addition to the site. If you’re taking a large dependency on IronPython, I’d also love to have a more in-depth write up posted about you: <a href="http://www.resolversystems.com" target="_blank">Resolver Systems</a> should definitely be on this list :) </li>    <li><em><strong>Many more code-snippets for the front-page which show IronPython’s strengths</strong></em>. Maybe a random code snippet every time you refresh, or a auto-cycling with some simple navigation to pause and go back-and-forth between them. </li>    <li><em><strong>Better organization of community articles</strong></em>: the IronPython community produces an enormous amount of documentation through blogs, articles, screencasts, and other mediums on the web. The IronPython website could never replicate this, so let’s make it a place to organize this information, grouping documentation together by topic and linking to the original author’s site. </li> </ul>  <p><strong><font color="#ff8000">Hope you like the new website!</font></strong></p>
