<div class="post-content">
Silverlight 2 Beta 1 was released at MIX08 this past week. Since I work on the dynamic languages team, getting our languages working in Silverlight is definitely something I wanted to do ... and we have!

<a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net">http://dynamicsilverlight.net</a>

Dynamic Silverlight is finally released! You can download the binaries and sources to Ruby, Python (the Iron implementation), the dynamic language runtime (DLR), the dynamic language and Silverlight integration, and Chiron: a dynamic Silverlight development utility, all in once package ... along with samples for Ruby and Python.

Everything here is released under the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/ms-pl.html">Microsoft Public License</a> (MSPL), so feel free to extend it, fork it, etc.

This release coincides with the release of Silverlight 2 Beta 1, as well as the MIX08 conference (<a href="http://visitmix.com">http://visitmix.com</a>). John Lam and I have a talk about dynamic silverlight at MIX, and we also had a lab which you can find here: <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/mix08-hol-ruby.zip">http://dynamicsilverlight.net/mix08-hol-ruby.zip</a>.

John Lam has posted a walk-through of our MIX demos here:
Part 1: <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silverl.html">http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silverl.html</a>
Part 2: <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silve-1.html">http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silve-1.html</a>
Part 3: <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silve-2.html">http://www.iunknown.com/2008/03/dynamic-silve-2.html</a>

This is what I've been working on since I started @ Microsoft in July'07, and I'm jazzed that I can now share it with people. Enjoy!
