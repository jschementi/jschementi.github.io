<p>Hello from Las Vegas! I'm speaking at <a href="http://www.devconnections.com/">DevConnections</a> about the integration of dynamic languages and the web. Eep! My first Microsoft public talk! Which is why I'm still awake ... cleaning up my talk and everything.</p>

<p>Seems every time I travel I forget something. This time: a USB cable for my camera! Grr, because I took some great pictures of the flight/hotel. The conference hotel is the Mandalay Bay, so I have a nice view of the Luxor, MGM, New York New York, etc, etc.</p>

<p>Anyway, I need some sleep for the big day. I will post slides/demos after my talk. In the meantime, take a look at <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/">John Lam's</a> blog about <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/11/ironruby-on-sil.html">IronRuby and Silverlight</a> :)
