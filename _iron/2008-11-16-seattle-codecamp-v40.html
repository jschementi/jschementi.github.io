<div class="post-content">
<p><img src="https://seattle.codecamp.us/images/CodeCampBanner.jpg" width="382" height="94" /> </p>  <p>I just finished speaking at <a href="https://seattle.codecamp.us/">Seattle CodeCamp v4.0</a> about dynamic languages in <a href="http://silverlight.net">Silverlight</a>, titled <a href="https://seattle.codecamp.us/sessions.aspx#Browser+meet+Ruby+and+Python">Browser, Meet Ruby and Python</a>. Here's my abstract:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>People entrenched in Visual Studio all day [sometimes] forget how powerful a command-line and a text-editor can be. Remember, these are the *tools* that built and continue-to-build the web. With nothing else up my sleeves (I wear short sleeves) I'll build a cool web applications with <a href="http://ironruby.net">IronRuby</a>, <a href="http://codeplex.com/ironpython">IronPython</a>, <a href="http://codeplex.com/aspnet">ASP.NET MVC</a>, and <a href="http://silverlight.net">Silverlight</a>, and show you why scripting/dynamic languages are powerful and productive tools.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Of course, that didn't end up being my exact talk, but close enough. I talked about REPL's, <a href="http://ironruby.net">IronRuby</a>, <a href="http://silverlight.net">Silverlight</a>, and Open Source. Here are the <a href="http://jimmy.schementi.com/downloads/seattle-code-camp-v4.0/seattle-code-camp-2008-11-16.pptx">slides</a> (<em>rename it to pptx since my web server is reporting it as a zip mime-type</em>), but I'll be making subsequent posts about the specific things I showed. Stay tuned!</p>
