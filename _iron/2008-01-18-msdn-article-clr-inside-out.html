<p>Seems like the February edition of MSDN Magazine is out ... in January ... go figure. Anyway, I wrote an "CLR Inside Out" article in October (yes, 4 months ago, and that was at the deadline) about Dynamic Languages in Silverlight, and it's in February's issue. </p>

<p>I talk mainly about the DLRConsole, an Silverlight sample of an interactive Silverlight canvas, written in IronPython.</p>
