Well, it just got it's first look, since before it was worse-looking than a 1990's-style website. Anyway, it's been bombarded with useful links, so let us walk through them:</p>

<p>
<a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/see">/see</a>
Here you'll find links to sample apps written in Ruby and Python. There's only 3 up there now, but we'll be adding more ... I promise. =)
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/get">/get</a>
Download pointers to the Dynamic Silverlight SDK, Silverlight 2, Silverlight SDK, Visual Studio Tools, etc etc etc. Basically anything you could ever want to use to develop a Silverlight app is there.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/learn">/learn</a>
Links to documentation, walk-throughs, blogs, talks, specs, and anything else to make you a browser ninja.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/contribute">/contribute</a>
So, when you're done getting and learning all about this stuff, time to actually talk to people! Here you'll find pointers to IronRuby/IronPython project information.
</p>

Enjoy! =)
