Lang.NET was a ton of fun! The room was constantly packed and the talks rocked. Though, I think the most interesting stuff happened in-between the talks, as usual. =)

<h4>Reactions</h4>

<p>
From a <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1135">informative</a> overview from Mary Jo Foley, a handful of <a href="http://dotnet-developments.blogs.techtarget.com/2008/01/29/langnet-shows-iron-python-with-robotics-studio-jscript-on-dlr/">articles</a>, and <a href="http://www.re-motion.org/blogs/team/archive/2008/01/28/announcing-remotion-mixins-at-lang.net-2008.aspx">tons</a> of <a href="http://headius.blogspot.com/2008/01/langnet-2008-day-1-thoughts.html">blog</a> <a href="http://blogs.tedneward.com/2008/01/29/Highlights+Of+The+LangNET+Symposium+Day+One.aspx">posts</a> from <a href="http://www.devhawk.net/2008/01/31/Morning+Coffee+141+LangNET+08+Edition.aspx">everyone</a> who <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/podwysocki/archive/2008/02/04/lang-net-and-rolling-your-own.aspx">attended</a>, Lang.NET was definitely buzzing the blogosphere.</p>

<p>
We passed around little surveys at the end of the event, and the feedback was great!

John Lam has a great <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/02/langnet-wrap-up.html">wrap-up</a> of Lang.NET on <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/">his blog</a>, complete with his <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/john_lam/sets/72157603823495954/">candid capturing</a> of the event.</p>

<h4>Videos</h4>

<p>
If you were at the event, you definitely saw me running around the whole time, pestering presenters and fiddling with electronics. If you didn't get to make it, all that work was for you!</p>
