Right after my classes I packed up and headed to Boston to see Felicia for a couple of days before heading home together.  But since I was so excited to see her I left a couple necessities back at school, like shower shoes, all my chargers, and my laptop!  Luckily Felicia is wonderful and let me take her laptop home with me to use. Meet Lappy, the 12-inch PowerBook.
