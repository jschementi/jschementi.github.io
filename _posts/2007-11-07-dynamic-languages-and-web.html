Today I gave a talk at DevConnections about Dynamic Languages and the Web. Officially the talk was called "Silverlight, ASP.NET, and Web Services in IronPython and IronRuby" ... but that's just too long! Anyway, thanks to everyone for coming; I enjoyed speaking with you all.

... and here's the goodies =)
