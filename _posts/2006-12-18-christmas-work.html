<div class="post-content">
So, 1st semester is done! I got through my last classes as a WPI student! Woohoo!

I drove home today ... well probably better call it commuting! I plan on working for most of it on all the projects I set aside during the semester, mostly in my underwear. =)

I'll leave you with this cool picture I took on the way home:
