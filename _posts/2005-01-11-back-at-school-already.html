Just imagine; I didn't have time to post here this break because I was so busy ... and you all know how busy I am at school.  Yeah, that was my break :-P

The holidays were difficult at first, but clarifying at the same time.  I'm a silly Jimmy.  But, it was great seeing family and friends.  Christmas with the little cousins and New Years at the Bekisz's were fun and I of course have the pictures to prove it!  Speaking of pictures, I got a new camera, Sony Cybershot DSC-T1 ... yes, the Stephen Tyler commercial =P  I also got my Blackberry, so my gadget collection is growing!

I finally build my new computer too!  It's a beast of a machine ... I'll post pictures and a walkthrough of how I built it soon ... just like I'm gonna finish my homepage ... right.  All I need to get is a S-Video to VGA converter and my 3 monitor setup is complete. =P

I worked for SMPL at the JJKennyDrake office in downtown NY.  Lets just say I was not fond of the commute, but a good breakfast and fun times more than made up for it.  I spend the 3+ weeks finishing some monitoring software, and writing a specific-task FTP client.  If they decide that software is a market they want to get into, this may turn into a more long term thing =P

So, now I'm back at school.  I've gotta verify that I'm out of the Boston IQP, and I've gotta apply for the graduate cs program.  Also, find a new IQP :-)

My room is still a wreck, so I think I'll change into PJs and clean until I call asleep.  Haha peace.
