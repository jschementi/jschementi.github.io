<div class="post-content">
Holy shit!  My Junior year of college is over!  ... we'll not quite, but close enough =)  AI was a complete fuckup, but I hopefully will get a B.  I'm still finishing up Friendly House stuff ... hopefully that will be done by Friday so I can go home =).

I've really got nothing interesting to talk about; I've been pretty boring recently =P
