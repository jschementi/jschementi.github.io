Woohoo, independence! With everything that's happened in the world, and to the US, I'm happy to be a US citizen and live in a country that fights for freedom. Though our practices are <span style="font-weight: bold;">very</span> weird at times, it's days like this that I know this country is doing the right thing ... but enough with politics.

Between going to the Space Needle, SciFi Museum / Experience Music Project, Golden Gardens beach, and Pier 55 for drinks, the past couple days have been really fun. Plus, I now live in Seattle! Check out the pictures, they're hot. Today I'm going to see the fireworks at Lake Union ... I think, so it should be fun. I'm doing laundry now ... so that's not fun.
