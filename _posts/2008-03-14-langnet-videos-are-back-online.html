<div style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size:100%;">The videos are now hosted on downloads.microsoft.com, after a <a href="http://jimmy.schementi.com/blog/2008/02/where-are-my-langnet-videos.html">hosting fiasco</a> and no where for 2GB of video to live. Luckily enough people care about those videos being available and helped to get them back up.</span>

<span style="font-style: italic;font-size:100%;" >The delay in getting them back up was mainly my fault: I was totally focused on <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://visitmix.com/">MIX08</a> when the videos went down, so this week was the only time I had to bug people. Sorry for the delay, but I'm sure it gave you some free time =).</span>

<span style="font-size:100%;">And for those who asked, I also put direct links to the video files on the talks page. Enjoy!</span></div>
