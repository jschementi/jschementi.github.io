<div class="post-content">
So, A-term 2004 at WPI has begun.  My schedule is located at <a href="http://www.iweblog.net/~jimmy/schedule">http://www.iweblog.net/~jimmy/schedule</a>.  Not bad, but physics is gonna be a tad annoying.  I'm fixing up my room alot; ripping stuff down, painting, etc.  I'm working on that when I can find the time.  Also getting a ton of new equipment soon ... can't wait =)

Other than school, I'm starting up my computer consulting business here in Worcester also.  Me and mike are working hard so hopefully we'll reap the rewards.

Anyway, I've gotta have something else to do.
