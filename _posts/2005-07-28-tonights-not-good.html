I'm not going to sleep well tonight ... Definitely going to be up worrying. She'll be ok ...

<strong>Update: </strong>so, I was wrong ... and right. Felicia ended up having surgery Thursday afternoon to remove a tumor and cyst at the base of her brain, but she's home now and doing amazingly ... for having 18 staples in her head!  But I don't care, I got my Felicia back! :)
