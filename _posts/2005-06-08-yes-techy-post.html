So ... it's 8:52 am ... drinking coffee and replying to email ... this will not be how I spend the rest of my life ...

Anyway, I'm perusing through CNN.com and reading some interesting articles.  First off, Google is being targeted for not doing enough towards protecting the privacy of it's visitors.  Unlike other companies, Google will hold on to information collected about you, like your IP address or what service you used what day, indefinately.  This does pose a problem where it could turn into a warehouse of personal information for goverenment use or otherwise.  However, people have to pull the pole out of their ass, if you will.  Cookies and IP addresses contain minimal information that can tie to a particular person.  Google actually goes to lengths to store this information.  They spend large sums of money to fund and maintain server farm just to retain this information they will use to make their products better.  All Google really needs to do is educate its customers on what privacy means and what Google does that they should know about.  In the end, lighten up.

Secondly, Apple has announced that all of its Macs will run on Intel chips by the end of 2007.  Whoa!  That's a pretty risky move since all the software written for Macs need to change to work on the new archetecture, but considering the small software base Apple has only companies like Microsoft, Adobe, Macromedia, etc, will be really effected.  Not to say that smaller companies won't be losing money on this move, but other software will come along.  I just want OX 10 on my Laptop :)

The ironic part of all this is the XBox 360, the next generation XBox to be released soon, has 3 IBM PowerPC processors.  I think we all are seeing the light ... a world where limits on what software runs on what hardware are more blurred.

But, Linux producers are going to stick with developing for the POWER platform.

Ok, that's my tech rant for the day :)
