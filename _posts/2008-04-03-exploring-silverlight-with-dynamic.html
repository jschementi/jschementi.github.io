<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/learn/dlrconsole"><img style="margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;" src="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/learn/dlrconsole/dlrconsole_Thumb.jpg" alt="" border="0" /></a>Last Wednesday all the language teams* in Redmond got together to eat food, drink beer, and talk about plans that are further out than all the time I've been programming. For the more short-sighted individuals like myself, we did some demos of technology that is right around the corner ... the next couple of years in Microsoft-land.

Anyway, I did a demo of dynamic languages in the browser, and then did a <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/learn/dlrconsole">screencast</a> of it so everyone could see it! It's posted on <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/learn">http://dynamicsilverlight.net/learn</a>, and you can view it using <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/learn/dlrconsole">Silverlight</a>, or download it in <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/learn/dlrconsole.mov">Quicktime</a> or <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net/learn/dlrconsole/dlrconsole.wmv">Windows Media</a> format.

Enjoy!
