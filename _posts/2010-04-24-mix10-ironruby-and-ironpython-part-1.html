If you’re a TV-person instead of a reading-person, here’s a video of the talk:</p>  <p class="section"><a href="http://live.visitmix.com/MIX10/Sessions/FT09" target="_blank"><img style="display: inline" title="image" alt="image" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/S6qrVHtweUI/AAAAAAAAAUg/RVL6vjAsKWM/image5.png?imgmax=800" width="400" height="225" /></a> </p>  <p class="section">As I usually do, this series of posts will be a write-up of my talk … but first …</p>  <blockquote class="section">   <p><strong><font color="#ff8000"><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/S6qrVURfhdI/AAAAAAAAAU8/anhVG5dFE8g/s1600-h/Slide10%5B1%5D.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="display: inline" title="Slide10" alt="Slide10" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/S6qrWbaTf7I/AAAAAAAAAVE/Iv14jTJoBL0/Slide10_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" width="360" height="270" /></a> </font></strong></p>    <p><strong><font color="#ff8000">iron?</font> - </strong>Jim Hugunin and John Lam have both been quoted as saying &quot;Iron&quot; stands for different acronyms; &quot;Implementation running on .NET&quot; and &quot;It runs on .NET&quot;, respectively. I’m going to put my foot down and officially side with Jim, though really they are bacronyms; neither is actually the original meaning. A <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1194309/why-are-many-ports-of-languages-to-net-prefixed-with-iron">StackOverflow</a> post explains more, and I hope that puts the wondering to rest.</p> </blockquote>  <p class="section">This talk is all about the why and how of <font color="#ff8000"><strong>embrace dynamic languages on Microsoft's web platform</strong></font> - be it on the web-server (IIS) or in the web-browser (Silverlight), and even in existing applications. To start out with, here’s my rational for why we as a developer community should care:</p>  <p class="section">It’s no secret that <strong><font color="#ff8000">developers like things to be simple</font></strong>, and the web is pretty simple as far as application models go. While the web’s feature-set is pretty attractive itself (server-client oriented, instant client deployment, and cross-platform clients to name a few), the equally attractive development experience (simple UI mark-up system and a scripting language) still make it easy for people to build amazing websites.</p>  <p class="section"><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/S6qrWn3XQ_I/AAAAAAAAAVM/quIxKntxHBk/s1600-h/Slide13%5B1%5D.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="display: inline" title="Slide13" alt="Slide13" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/S6qrXpJmfOI/AAAAAAAAAVQ/IzeXCfL87tc/Slide13_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" width="400" height="300" /></a> </p>  <p class="section">Though the application model is simple, <font color="#ff8000"><strong>developers continue to evolve it</strong></font>; server and client frameworks are vital tools that make the web-development experience even more productive – it’s very rare that a website has no server side or client side dependencies.</p>  <p class="section"><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/S6qrYKz9pvI/AAAAAAAAAVY/pzdJZgxmIAU/s1600-h/Slide18%5B1%5D.jpg" target="_blank"><img style="display: inline" title="Slide18" alt="Slide18" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/S6qrYi1OSMI/AAAAAAAAAVg/gIK3pQR9eXI/Slide18_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" width="400" height="300" /></a> </p>  <p class="section">These frameworks provide such innovative features because they stand on the shoulders of powerful and expressive dynamic/scripting languages, giving the frameworks the unique ability to model the &quot;web&quot; as they see fit.</p>  <p class="section">While each web-framework is powerful in its own right, the power really comes from the <font color="#ff8000"><strong>choice to use whatever tools help get things done</strong></font>. Developers and designers for .NET have the same need to get things done, and if <font color="#ff8000"><strong>getting things done is essentially the result of programming language choice</strong></font>, what choices are there? Really only C# and VB, which are static programming languages, requiring a compile step before execution and relying on debugging to see code in action. Take a look at the other languages mainly used on the web again -- they're all dynamic languages, running from source code, and providing interactive environments for running code. <strong><font color="#ff8000">Why is .NET static while the rest of the web is dynamic?</font></strong> Why can't they exist together? If .NET provided some language choice for developers, all the languages be used together, and the <font color="#ff8000"><strong>.NET community could benefit from the amazing work being done by dynamic language community</strong></font>, and visa versa.</p>  <p class="section"><strong><font color="#ff8000">We in-fact live in this world</font></strong>, and embracing dynamic languages is possible on .NET, but <strong><font color="#ff8000">why would you want to do it</font></strong>?
