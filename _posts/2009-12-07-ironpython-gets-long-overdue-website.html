<p align="left">In preparation for the <a href="http://ironpython.net/download/" target="_blank">final IronPython 2.6 release</a>, the project finally gets a nice homepage: <a href="http://ironpython.net" target="_blank"><strong>IronPython.net</strong></a>!</p>  <p><a href="http://ironpython.net" target="_blank"><img style="display: inline" title="image" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/Sx1zp94rEZI/AAAAAAAAANU/O9hFVBdxEBQ/image%5B7%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="400" height="253" /></a> </p>  <p><a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com" target="_blank">CodePlex</a> will continue to be the tool we use for project management and releases, but all end-user information will be on <a href="http://ironpython.net" target="_blank">IronPython.net</a>. Also, the .com domain still points at the super-old site, but will redirect to this site shortly.</p>  <p>The most notably addition is the <a href="http://ironpython.net/documentation/dotnet/" target="_blank">.NET Integration Documentation</a>, a thorough set of examples and descriptions of using IronPython with .NET. Considering this is IronPython’s main purpose, it’s amazing we got away with having hardly no documentation for this long … I guess the .NET integration is just that intuitive :) Anyway, please give it a read and let us know if you have any suggestions.</p>  <h4><font color="#ff8000">There’s a ton left to do!</font></h4>  <p>This site is very much a shell of what it could be, and I’d love for the IronPython community to help out here. Here are a few things I’d like to add to the site in the very near future; please let me know if you’d lie to help out, or have other ideas:</p>  <ul>   <li><em><strong>Who’s using IronPython?</strong></em> A list of companies, public websites, and any type of application which use IronPython, in any way, would be a great addition to the site. If you’re taking a large dependency on IronPython, I’d also love to have a more in-depth write up posted about you: <a href="http://www.resolversystems.com" target="_blank">Resolver Systems</a> should definitely be on this list :) </li>    <li><em><strong>Many more code-snippets for the front-page which show IronPython’s strengths</strong></em>. Maybe a random code snippet every time you refresh, or a auto-cycling with some simple navigation to pause and go back-and-forth between them. </li>    <li><em><strong>Better organization of community articles</strong></em>: the IronPython community produces an enormous amount of documentation through blogs, articles, screencasts, and other mediums on the web. The IronPython website could never replicate this, so let’s make it a place to organize this information, grouping documentation together by topic and linking to the original author’s site. </li> </ul>  <p><strong><font color="#ff8000">Hope you like the new website!</font></strong></p>

    Awesome.<br /><br />My company is taking a pretty big dependency on IronPython ASP.Net (this is why I&#39;ll be bugging you for an updated IP support once 2.6 is final :)<br /><br />We use it in our CMS so that people can just drop in a bunch of aspx page with IronPython edited online.<br /><br />We also use IP as well in our government  business license system for calculating fees (with 350 different fees structure) - so that the accountants can go mad and &#39;program&#39; whatever fees they want.<br /><br />Pretty much IronPython has become a standard toolkit in our development  process. Any new projects we are doing comes with the latest IronPython binaries and any designs will have at least one &quot;stick IronPython here&quot; part.

    Nice looking site! I like the speed comparisons, but the <a href="http://ironpython.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Differences" rel="nofollow">language differences</a> are not getting nearly as much love. Its hard to tell if differences from the previous versions of IronPython and CPython are still applicable for IronPython 2.6 and CPython 2.6.

    Good news! Btw... is there any ironpython forum online? If not, ironpython.net should have one!
