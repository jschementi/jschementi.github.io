Ok, so yeah, remember what I said about an easy term? HA! Cog Skills has turned into a very work intensive class, i'm getting tired of playing knockout every day for Basketball ... the only class which is still pretty easy is Microecon. My IQP started recently, and that's not gonna be that bad, but it's a really good thing.

So Gamestock has come and gone. RedBull wasn't able to get on campus, but Coke was able to provide alot of the same stuff. I really don't think they should sell FullThrottle to people under 21 ... since you can most definately get drunk off it. Also, Theta Chi Elections have come and gone ... I'm treasurer again. This will be a much easier 'term' for me .. .since i've seen it all before.

Anyway, I have a new favorite band!! Averi! They really kick ass; check out their website: <a href="http://www.averimusic.com">http://www.averimusic.com</a>. They played at WPI and yeah, woohoo.

Ok, I'm gonna use this little free time to organize myself and make sure I'm not forgetting anything, like registering for my IQP ... oh woops ... I need to do that ... ha! Ok, take care.
