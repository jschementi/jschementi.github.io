It's 4am, I gotta wake up at 8, why the <strong>hell</strong> am I not in bed???

You people realize you can add comments to my posts!!  If you don't have a blogger account, just post anonymously.  I'd like to at least feel special by seeing comments =P

Ok ok, I shouldn't post retarted sleep deprived posts like this one ... my bad, I'll make it up to ya =)
