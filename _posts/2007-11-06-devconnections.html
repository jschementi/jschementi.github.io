I'm speaking at <a href="http://www.devconnections.com/">DevConnections</a> about the integration of dynamic languages and the web. Eep! My first Microsoft public talk! Which is why I'm still awake ... cleaning up my talk and everything.

Seems every time I travel I forget something. This time: a USB cable for my camera! Grr, because I took some great pictures of the flight/hotel. The conference hotel is the Mandalay Bay, so I have a nice view of the Luxor, MGM, New York New York, etc, etc.

Anyway, I need some sleep for the big day. I will post slides/demos after my talk. In the meantime, take a look at <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/">John Lam's</a> blog about <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2007/11/ironruby-on-sil.html">IronRuby and Silverlight</a> :)
