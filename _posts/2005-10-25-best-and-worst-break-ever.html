<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
I had to come back to school last Monday since grad classes don't "break" during the undergrad break ... boooo. So to make a long story short, I've been doing a lot of compilers work/studying, and getting kinda frustrated ... hopefully I can clear some of my questions up today.

Anyone how knows me well knows I sometimes get upset at concerts ... because I wish I was up there on stage. Well, this past friday I was able to indulge a little bit of that and play an Open-Mic Night @ Clark! I played a bunch of Averi, Live, some of my own, and finished with a Stephen Lynch song ... yeah i know, haha. I also bought the guitar I'm playing in the picture the day before! I've been talking about buying that guitar for years, so I finally just did it. But yeah, after the show I hung out with Allison, Nadine, Maya, and the gang.  "The scariest thing ever was being a New Yorker during the last world series!"

Anyway, undergrad classes start today, I'm going to a class today @ 10am just "incase", there is no hot water, and I'm not dressed yet. Fun. Bye.
