OK, I warn all of you now that this will be a tech-rant and shows that I need a way of seperating my blog subjects .... anyway ...

I've been reading <span style="font-weight: bold;">a lot </span>of blogs and news posts about all the new motion around Mac OS moving to the Intel architecture and Apple making it easy to install Windows XP on Apple Hardware ... and I want to clear up a couple points.

First off, people are saying that Apple's decision to move to the Intel architecture makes their systems less-secure.  That's the wrong way to look at it.  The architecture can help make a OS more secure, but PowerPC and Intel architectures are no more or less secure than eachother.  The real issue is that the move to Intel caused more people to buy Macs ... and some of that group are malicious crackers looking to release exploids to OS X.  In other words, now that more people are using Mac OS it is more succeptable to worms, viruses, exploits, to be created and distributed.

Lets back up for a second.  Mac OS is build ontop of the BSD kernel, a version of the linux kernel ... and is now called Darwin.  There have been versions of Darwin for PPC and x86 ever since Mac OS 10.0 came out.  This software is Open Source and constantly under review by the community responcible for maintaining it, causing bugs to be found and patched quicker.  Windows, aside from being proprietary software, has been a constant addon to the previous versions.  If we were to look through the code of XP we would find code originally from Windows 3.1 and 95.  This is extremely dangerous since Windows 3.1 was pre-internet and security measures were not taken when adding internet capabilities to 95.  So, without going into too much detail, the core software of Mac OS <span style="font-weight: bold;">is</span> more secure than Windows.

However, Apple isn't out of the water.  Mac OS is getting more popular and, as we are seeing now, exploits are being created.  Apple just released a patch that fixed 40 exploits in iTunes and Quicktime.  This is <span style="font-weight: bold;">not </span>directly because Mac OS now runs on the Intel architecture; the same exploits exist in the PPC version.  However, like I said before, it is because the move to the Intel architecture opens OS X to a wider audience.

To drive the point home one more time, security is all about the software, regardless of architecture.  I could write the most insecure Mac app (trust me, they do exist) and exploit any users ... regardless of being morally wrong ... and it would affect the PPC and Intel users alike. 

To quickly wrap this up, Mac OS X does have vunerabilities.  As more people start using it more will be found.  I can't comment on the security features of Windows Vista, but Mac OS X provides more potential to secure yourself than Windows XP.  Just remember, be smart in that great big internet of ours, install anti-virus software and keep the definitions up-to-date, and do not use internet explorer 6 ... on whatever platform you're using ... and you'll be right as rain.

OK peeps, you can wake up now and move on with your lives :)
