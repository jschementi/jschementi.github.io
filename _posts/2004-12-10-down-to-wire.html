<div class="post-content">
School is crazy now.  Projects, Finals, Theta Chi things, crazy.  I'm actually happy the weekend is here so I can dedicate more time to work!  Yeah, feel free to slap me in the face.

I've just finished a web design for a client, and it came out really nice :).  Schementec stuff is kicking; i actually got a phone call from a guy who wanted us to outsource our work!  Rest assured, we're going to keep our employees in the US, but geeze was it tempting.

So a couple days ago Worcester was attacked by ice.  The trees and grass were beautifully coated with ice, making it a sight to see and a difficult time to walk.  Yeah, ice skates would have actually helped :P.  I was very upset I didn't get any pictures :(

Ok, need to work!
