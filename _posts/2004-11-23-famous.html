Here's a mirror of the article about the new Interactive Media and Game Development (IMGD) major at WPI. Being the head of the Game Development Club at WPI, Chris and I were interviewed for our take on the major. Sweet!

So, one more day and then Thanksgiving break! Gonna be a nice break from the school craziness; seeing old friends, turkey, and a knicks game with felicia!

But, one more night of school work =(
