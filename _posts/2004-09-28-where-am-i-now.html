<div class="post-content">
Well, today I woke up iu a tent ... on the QUAD ... yes ... camping at school ...

So last week was interesting. I stayed at Mike's old apartment for a night, and then stayed at Tiff and Jess's place for the next 3 nights. I've been humming that Steven Lynch song since =P.

I got to see Felicia this weekend! Saturday was her sister's Sweet 16, so her parents flew us back to NY for it. Felicia and I have an ongoing joke about how we "don't follow baseball", in fear that a RedSox fan would kill us ... strangly enough when I got on the train to Boston the conductor says "$6 to Boston, but if you're a Yankee's fan pay double!" Freaken RedSox fans ...

Anyway, when I got into Boston Felicia met me at the train station =)  We got a little lost getting to her dorm, but that's a usual occurance for us.  After i dropped my things off we went to a steak place, around the corner from her dorm, called Rockbottom. And yes, the RedSox game was on there ... can't excape it. The food was really good though :). We ended up staying in just because we didn't want to drive the kids working at the security desk crazy with signing me in and out.

After like 6 hours of sleep, we woke up at 7am to get out of her dorm by 8 and go to the airport to catch a 10 o'clock flight. Airtime = 38 minutes :-P. Rediculous. We got a little shuttle plane; 3 seats wide plus a little aisle. I took ALOT of pictures from the air =).

Felicia's dad picked us up from JFK (after going to LaGuardia first =P) and I got home around 12:30. Just enough time to change into my suit and go out the door to the party. It was fun though; brought back nice memories of Felicia's sweet 16. After the party all Nicole's friends came back to her house ... and her parents decided to go out ... and Felicia fell asleep, making my life soooo fun; watching 16 year olds ... blah. I got to bed by 1am and slept FOREVER!

The flight back to Boston wasn't bad either. We origionally had a 7pm flight ... which would have got me into Worcester by 1amish ... ouch. Plus, Felicia wanted to get back earlier. So, I worked my magic and got us ahead of the line and onto a 2:20pm flight :). However, our seats weren't together. I ended up sitting by the bathroom and the engine ... I had a miserable 36 minutes back =(. Plus there were so many open seats ... so yeah, not fun. Anyway, we got back to her dorm and got a HUGE slice of pizza before I went back to school.

She walked me to the train, which was sweet. I missed her almost immediately once we said goodbye ... and that says it all. This is what we talked about ever since we started dating; being so close that we can see eachother alot ... but I'm just a guy head over heals about a girl, even after 2 and a half years. I thought girls said those type of guys were keepers?

Anyway, I've got class in a bit, so I'll save the "Tent City" portion until next time :)
