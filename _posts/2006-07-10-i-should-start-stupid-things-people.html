<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
So, I went to Mt. Rainier this Saturday, and have the burns to prove it, but on the bus ride there someone said this:

"Snow is a plant" ... "Why? Because it grows. Bet you didn't know that; now you do."

The context this comment was in doesn't even justify it ... why do stupid people insist on speaking?

I rest my case.
