So, classes have been going on for more than a week now.  It's not too bad, though this Physics class is a lot of retarted work.  Computer graphics and OOAD are going really well ... it's gonna be a pretty basic term.  The GDC is getting really busy now with recruiting freshmen and all.  As for Theta Chi ... the first social was awesome!  Everyone seems to be having fun, so all is well

As for other work, Schementec is in full swing up here.  Our website can be found here (<a href="http://www.schementec.com">http://www.schementec.com</a>).  Mike and I have an interview with the Worcester Business Journal tomorrow!  So yeah, exciting times.  Also, we're getting business cards tomorrow!  Tripsoft is cookin' too, and I'm also working as a tools programmer for a game development company!

Felicia goes to school on the 4th!  She'll be like an hour away from me now.  Hopefully I get to see her a bunch.  We'll see =)

Anyway, time to get back to various work.  Ciao!
