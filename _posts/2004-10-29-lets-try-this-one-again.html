Ok, I wrote this, and then did a retarted thing by hitting my back button ... and it forgot all the text =(.  User-interface issue? ... yeah, but I should know better =P

Anywho, I've been back at school for a week.  When I came back last week I visited Felicia.  It was great seeing her again,  and I got to meet her roommate and Emerson friends.  I'm happy she enjoys college.   That night there was a "Pumpkin Festival" on the commons ... very cool.  I'll put some of those pictures up here soon.  Then I made sure she got on her bus home, and headed back to Worcester.

So yeah, classes ... Computer Networks, Human/Computer Interactions, and Physics 2.  Not bad.  Networks is GREAT!  Gonna have fun with this class.  Other than that, school will be pretty routine ... but not at Theta Chi ... cause Rush starts!  Let us see how this goes ...

I've got tons of work to do, so I'm gonna cut this short.  A piu tardi.
