    <p>Yesterday I launched Starline (<a href="http://starline.schementec.com">starline.schementec.com</a>), a web-based point-of-sale app. It was initially written in Visual Basic for a specific restaurant, a project Mike Veilleux started and I continued. Weâ€™ve moved between so many different iterations, but now it's landed on a web app, and feels much better. Check it out!</p>
