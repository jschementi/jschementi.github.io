<div class="post-content">
Ok, so that holiday season just flew by.  So, the end of 2005 ... eh, it doesn't phase me, I won't miss the year much.  When really bad things happen it always seems that really good things accompany, and visa versa.  When people say "oh that was such a terrible year," I dunno, I feel like they're just focusing on the negative.  Anyway, lets not get into that.

So I'm working at SMPL again this break, and I'm really torn now b\c I really want to start working for them, but I've decided to stay on for grad school, so hopefully I can just do it part time or something, we'll see.

So now I'm juggling that, my compilers project, a little work on the fsae website, and my personal website.  Yeah, about stopping time ... anyone figured that one out yet?
