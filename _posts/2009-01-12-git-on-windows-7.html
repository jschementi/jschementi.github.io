<p>I use <a href="http://gitscm.org" target="_blank">Git</a> everyday, whether it be for <a href="http://ironruby.net" target="_blank">IronRuby</a>, <a href="http://github.com/jschementi/agdlr" target="_blank">AgDLR</a>, or random other Rails/Ruby work. Being that I work at Microsoft, I got my hands on earlier build of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7" target="_blank">Windows 7</a> during the fall. Unfortuantely, git didn’t work fully on Windows 7, failing whenever a merge happened, which made push fail, as well as pull when trying to get other people’s changes). <a href="http://blog.jredville.com/" target="_blank">Jim Deville</a> has been tracking this with the Windows team, and even bringing it up to the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/" target="_blank">msysgit</a> maintainer to see if there’s any way around this. It was looking grim, so I left my main development machine on Vista, and was sad.</p><p>Windows 7 Beta was released this past Friday, and I managed to download the .iso, get a Product Key, etc, at home during the day on Saturday. Now that it’s released, I’m guessing other people will have this problem ...</p><p>I’m not sure of the specific details behind the issue, but msysgit calls into C:\windows\system32\msvcrt.dll during a merge, and the changes to that DLL in Windows 7 breaks msysgit. Last week, <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/" target="_blank">John Lam</a> was describing the issue to John Messerly, and realized that the easiest fix would be to copy the Windows Vista msvcrt.dll to the C:\Program Files\Git\bin directory, since Windows DLL resolution will look on the PATH, and “.” is included.</p><p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/curth/default.aspx" target="_blank">Curt Hagenlocher</a> just <a href="http://twitter.com/chagenlocher/status/1112241244" target="_blank">reminded me of the fix</a>, and it works!</p><p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/SWq-biEzmNI/AAAAAAAAAHA/9JoANeiZnlE/s1600-h/gitwin7%5B7%5D.png"><img style="display: inline" title="gitwin7" alt="gitwin7" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/SWq-cVMzCYI/AAAAAAAAAHE/w7lqk80YTsM/gitwin7_thumb%5B5%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="400" height="155" /></a> </p><p>Pretty awesome. Enjoy Git in Windows 7!</p>
