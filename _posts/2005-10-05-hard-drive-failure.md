Friday night my computer started to act weird.  I backed up all my data to another location of the drive where it would be safe, but I didn't think to get it off my computer and onto something else like another hard drive or DVDs.  That was my mistake.  Something went wrong and I lost access to all my files.  There are still on my hard drive but I can't get to them.

I'm thinking of sending the hard drive to a data recovery company to see if they can fix it, but it's going to cost more than $1K  to recover the data.

Moral of the story ... back up your data!
