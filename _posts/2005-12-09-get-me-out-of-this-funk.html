OK, so this funk I'm in is kinda annoying.  I feel unproductive, lonely, and just overall not happy with myself.  Today helped a little ... I didn't get much done but I cleaned my room and just doing that, making my life "appear" organized may help a little, who knows.

Tomorrow's Friday and I plan on finishing alot tomorrow ... hopefully I'll be able to do that so a little less is hanging on my shoulders for this weekend ...
