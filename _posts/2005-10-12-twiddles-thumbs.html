<div class="post-content">
I got my new hard drives today ... so i'm transfering all my files to the new drive ... and it's taking forever!  My 3rd monitor is messed up, but I need to wait until these files finish transfering to do anything ... ugh.

Anyway, I saw "Waiting" today; it was the funniest non-sencical movie ever!  Seriously, it had no plot, much like clerks, but just rediculous lines and things.  It had a decent message, but who cares!  I suggest seeing it if you can't wait till HBO/DVD.

146 minutes left ....

My parents came by AGAIN today ... this is pretty crazy now.  I don't feel the need to go home now, and it's weird.

Ugh, this post is very random .... but my head hurts and i'm kinda tired ... so i don't feel too bad about it ... so f-off :)
