Wow, what a crazy 3 weeks. Lots of craziness. But, it's all back to normal ... or as normal as it can get =P.

So last week we camped out on the QUAD to raise $$$ for fire victims. It was pretty successful ... other than the hurricane that hit and tossed all of our tents. I swear ... we can't live anywhere without a disaster happening =(

MY ROOM IS DONE! About time ... geez. I'll post some pictures of it once it's clean =). Just gotta catch myself up to school and get a work habit again.

So, the title of this post is Back to "Normal". The quotes are there for a reason. Though I may now have a home and a consistant place to sleep ... I'm missing something more important.  Almost 9 months is too long ... I'm scared.  I worry about you, I think about you alot, and I miss you even more.  Everything's not the same without you.

I hope you have a good weekend
