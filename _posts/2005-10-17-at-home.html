<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
So, A-term is over and I'm back at home ... but damn it's been a crazy time!

First off, my computer is back! And now with daily backups ... oh joy! So I've been playing catch-up a little with school and work stuff, but overall not bad.

So I finally broke down and bought myself a Flickr account. :) You can see my pictures at <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jschementi">http://www.flickr.com/photos/jschementi</a>. I'm going to have them show on my website as well, but for the time being there you go!

Also, we had our first party of the year ... and what is the theme you might ask? Black and White! Ah! But, it was really fun ... take a look at my pictures. I had a lot of fun, and hopefully it's the start of some good things for me. ;)

I was recently asked why I keep a journal or blog ... and to be quite honest I don't know. Maybe I just need a way to expose a part of myself to people ... or maybe I just need to write. I think it's so I can have a history about myself that I can always get to .... that's probably it. When I almost lost everything ... all I could care about was missing my pictures ... the memories. So, why I keep this isn't as important to me as knowing that it's there.
