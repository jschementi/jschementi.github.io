Right after my classes I packed up and headed to Boston to see Felicia for a couple of days before heading home together.  But since I was so excited to see her I left a couple necessities back at school, like shower shoes, all my chargers, and my laptop!  Luckily Felicia is wonderful and let me take her laptop home with me to use. Lappy!

I also gotten a bunch of stuff done this break.  Finished 2 MSBS projects (graphics and ooad), finished a web design for a client, and I'm now starting on my own homepage!  Woohoo, and all from a lll' 12-inch PowerBook! Might get one of these for myself.
