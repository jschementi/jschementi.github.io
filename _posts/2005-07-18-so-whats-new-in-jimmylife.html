<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
I'm at work now ... just put in a good 2 hours of work ... time for a break!  So, what's been new with me?  Where to begin ...

GE is going okay.  Lets just say that I know what I don't want to do :)  ::ps ... I just took a break and lunch ... now it's 1PM .. haha.  Anyway, I definitely know I want to be an engineer now, and it makes it more clear that I should start my own business.  So, other than work, the weekdays are fun with the interns; playing basketball and crazy nights out (when I get my website finished you'll see the pictures :)]) ... good times.

As for my "not day job", I'm juggling 2 website jobs; one is making significant updates and another one is from scratch.  Check <a href="http://www.schementec.com">http://www.schementec.com</a> on the portfolio for screenshots and links.  I'm also working on a resturant software application, codename Pos, ... I won't discuss it here but I should have something up about it on schementec's soon-to-exist software products page ... check it out.  I've also gotta make some updates to Theta Chi's site ... woohoo.

Once all that is done, I've got some major plans for MY website ... yes, it's the everlasting constant of designers; makes everyone elses website but their own.  It's going to be an integration on my blog(with categories), pictures, songs, portfolio, projects (school/personal), resume, and other things I haven't thought of.  I've been going for 2 years without a significant web presence for myself, so now's the time ...

Felicia's hasn't been feeling well for a while ... looks like she's getting over mono ... poor girl =(.
