<div class="post-content">
So yeah, I haven't gone to sleep yet ... and it's just about that time when I need to shower and get ready for my day ... geeze.

"Yesterday" was my HCI final and Networks project.  Today is turning in my Physics labs, physics final, and studying for networks tomorrow.  I also have to find time to do my HCI project =P.  I used to think there weren't enough hours in a day ... but I was looking in the wrong place ... using the hours you sleep for work is a HUGE chunk of time ...

:: dozes off ::

:: shakes :: ... Ok ok, maybe not the best idea.

Ya know, it doesn't even feel like the holidays.  That's terrible.  The most I've seen of the monetary side of Christmas is a dude in my Networks class wearing a Santa hat ... sad.  I was suppose to get lights for the house this past weekend ... yeah, decided to spend the entire thing on networks.  That's the christmas spirit ...

Hmm, what else is new ... oh!  I cut my hand pretty badly like 2 weeks ago.  Yeah, I'd post a picture but I know some people are sensitive to open wounds =P.  Soo ... now I get to add this to the "stupid shit I've done list", prepended by cutting a live wire with a sissor and cutting off the tip of my finger.  Sweet.

OK, I may want to get ready ... we'll see.
