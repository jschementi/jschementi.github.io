<div class="post-content">
So, today's my 22nd birthday!  My dad came up to visit me for the day, and we ate house food, talked, went to the Worcester Art Gallary for the first time that is 2 minutes away from the house, and ate dinner at Vinny T's.  Overall it was a pretty fun day.

Oh, and Microsoft got back to me before dinner and make me a job offer .... ah!  So yeah, long story short I'm a Microsoft intern for the summer ... freaken weird.  Do I have to start one of those Microsoft employee blogs where I say how much I love the company and their products?  Ha, but I'm sure my posts when I'm there will be much more often and generally Microsoft related.

Soo, what am I going to be doing there?  Most likely dynamic language work, which is super cool :).  Anyway, these next couple weeks are going to be insane, so I need to buckle down and finish everything.  ::blows out the candles::
