<span style="font-weight: bold;">Videos are back up! Enjoy!</span>

<strike><span style="font-weight: bold;">2nd Video update:</span> Woohoo! I got the videos moved to a new server! ... with the help of some great Microsoft people, of course. The links will be live within a couple hours, and once they are I will update langnetsymposium.com to point the the videos again. Thanks for your patience!</strike>
<strike>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Video update:</span> It's taken way too long to get these back up, my apologies; MIX08 was basically all last week for me ... and nothing really happened on the Lang.NET front. They will find a home on microsoft.com or silverlight.net, but either way I'm finding somewhere for them today! I'll keep you posted ...</strike>

With <a href="http://visitmix.com/">MIX08</a> breathing down my neck and Murphy's law in full force, Wednesday afternoon I noticed http://langnetsymposium.com was strangely transformed into a Mail Server login page. This was not that surprising to me, as I had 7 emails and 2 missed calls from our hosting company saying we were over-quota on bandwidth and disk space. Ugh.

Here's the exact message from our hosters:
<blockquote>
This email is to inform you that LangNet Symposium has exceeded its bandwidth allocation on the server of 5G per month. This is due to a 5,000% increase in traffic over the last few days increasing bandwidth usage in excess of 125GB per day which translates to 3.75 terabytes per month. Specifically, the access of video files appears to be the primary cause for this.</blockquote>
5,000% increase in traffic! Wow! Ironically, this is great news; people really really care about the Lang.NET videos! Thought those numbers don't really suprise me, the quote that the hosting company gave me does. To make a long story short, <strike>I'm looking to find the videos a new home as we speak.</strike> the videos have found a new home on downloads.microsoft.com, though the links to the Silverlight videos will still work. <strike>The site should be back online on Friday, and the videos shortly after that. It sucks to not have them up now, but oh well ... go outside, spend time with your kids ... the videos will be there when you get back. =)</strike>

    It would be great to make the videos downloadable, especially via torrent.  Torrent would help with the bandwidth issues too.<BR/><BR/>We can't download them via the Silverlight interface.<BR/><BR/>Thanks! RC

    I'm also all for the bittorrent option!  I'm sure many LANG.NET enthusiasts would be more than willing to leave open their bittorrent clients and help with the distribution.

    Exactly <B><I>which</I></B> Friday did you mean when you said the videos should be back online shortly after Friday? I am looking at my calendar and there are a lot of Fridays on it. : )<BR/><BR/>We are waiting with baited breath.

    Sorry for the delay everyone.<BR/><BR/>@Stuart Celarier<BR/>The website was down last-last Friday , so that Friday I speak of refers to when it was back online ... I know, Friday is ambiguous ... =)<BR/><BR/>Anyway, these videos are going onto either YouTube or Google Video today simply to get them up somewhere. The Silverlight videos will eventually make their way to microsoft.com or silverlight.net.
