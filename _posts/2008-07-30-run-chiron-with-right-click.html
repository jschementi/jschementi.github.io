<p><a title="Pluto / Chiron" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21063632@N07/2706001250/"><img border="0" alt="Pluto / Chiron" src="http://static.flickr.com/3271/2706001250_e1b8bc4020.jpg" width="396" height="178" /></a></p>  <p>About a month ago <a href="http://haacked.com/" target="_blank">Phil Haack</a> posted a <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2008/06/24/vs2008-web-server-here-shell-extension.aspx" target="_blank">registry hack to run the ASP.NET Web Server from a directory's right-click menu</a>, and I thought it would be pretty awesome to have some right-click options for Chiron. Finally decided today would be the day for that:</p>  <p><span class="arrow"></span><a href="http://jimmy.schementi.com/silverlight/chiron-here.zip">&#8595; Download chiron-here.zip</a></p>  <p><a title="chiron-here" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/24458122@N00/2715864992/"><img border="0" alt="chiron-here" src="http://static.flickr.com/3214/2715864992_05f5561f5c.jpg" /></a></p>  <p><em>Note: You will need to have the <a href="http://codeplex.com/sdlsdk" target="_blank">Silverlight Dynamic Languages SDK</a> for any of this to work; only sdl-sdk.zip is required. </em></p>  <h4><font color="#ff8000">Installation (please read!)</font></h4>  <p>chiron-here.reg assumes that you unzipped sdl-sdk.zip into C:\sdl-sdk. If this is not the case, open chiron-here.reg in your editor of choice (notepad will do) and change the <strong>two paths</strong> to point to your sdl-sdk location.</p>  <p>To install, simply double-click on chiron-here.reg. Say *Yes* to the prompt if you *really* want to install it. That's it! No reboot required.</p>  <p>Take a look at the README for usage. If you're a Windows person hacking Silverlight with Ruby/Python/JScript, this could definitely be useful. Enjoy!</p>
