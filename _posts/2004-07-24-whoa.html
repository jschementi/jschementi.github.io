<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
So, it's 1:26AM and I'm ripping Sex in the City episodes =P.  Yes, it is fun. 

Another week done, and a weekend coming that will entail lots of song writing!  Yeah, I know, I never thought I'd hear those words too.  I'm planning on recording a bunch of new stuff, plus clean up some older songs.  I'll post a link to my music when I fix my homepage. 

Other than my songs, I intend to do a mininal amount of work and try to rest as much as possible. It's been a busy week, and an <em>amazing</em> day today, so what better to follow but a restful 2 days? ... but I most likely will code ... lots ... well, at least fix my webstuff. 

Time to get these episodes ripping and get to bed.
