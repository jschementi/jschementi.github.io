There will be a trip down memory lane, Ruby, Python, .NET, Macs, Robots, Music, and spontaneity; it will be epic.</p><p style="line-height: 1.4em"><font size="3"><font color="#ff8000"><strong>Jimmy hacking (at) Microsoft</strong> </font></font>    <br />

Fuller Auditorium, Fuller Labs     <br />
Worcester Polytechnic Institute     <br />
100 Institute Road     <br />
Worcester, MA 01609 </p><p>I'm flying to NY tonight (woot for red-eyes) with Felicia, and then driving/busing (depends how much work is left to do ;)) to Worcester Sunday. Should be a fun couple of days.</p><p>If you're in the Worcester-area, stop by! Slides/Demos will be posted shortly after the talk, and I'm looking into recording.</p>
