The weekends tend to get better and better as the summer goes along. Friday I went to Capitol Hill with someone <span style="font-style: italic;">very cool </span>for sushi and then a movie, "Word Play." Dinner was great, and Word Play was great at well; it's a movie about the New York Times Crossword puzzle. It was kind of nostalgic for me having the movie be about New York and all. I never knew how suspenseful a crossword puzzle tournament could be! These people were amazing ... finishing puzzles in like 2 minutes ... damn.

Ok, I've got to actually accomplish something at work today ... ::scurries::
