<div class="post-content">
Yep, another one of those nights where I can't sleep.  And I've been on edge for about 5 days now ... so it's not a fun time for the Jimmy.

I did get a mock-up version of my gallery working though =).  The process is alittle annoying though.  I have to upload the files myself to the server, then run a PHP shell script that creates the thumbnails and smaller images.  I tried just having PHP do that on the fly ... ssssslllloooowwww.  So yeah, until I write an upload image client ... i'm stuck =P.

Once this gallery is working right my site will start to get content again!  Imagine ... hehe.  Well, I may be able to sleep ... maybe ...
