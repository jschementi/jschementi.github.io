Ok, I want to go to bed, but I've got this itch in my brain that I just have to write about ... so I'm gonna try to make this as short as possible and then (possibly) later expand upon it.

For all those bloggers out there, why do you do it?  Is it to get your words into the public eye?  But whose your public?  And why are they going to read what you have to write?  These questions must plague all types of publiciations, but blogging is different; there can be no domain.  One blog could be about someone's personal life while another could be about a new technology.  How do we deliver this information to our desired audience efficiently when we have all these things on our mind?

My blog suffers from this, badly.  I've got very personal posts, exposing my emotions and feelings, and other posts that are just general updates on my life (which are the weirdest), and then techy posts, music posts, etc etc etc.  Obviously I may want to shelter certain posts from people, or make sure a search engine picks up only the ones I want people to see.  What's the best way to do this?

The options I see are having seperate blogs, or category filters on one blog.  The first option would be to make a seperate blog for each "topic".  For instance, I could make this blog only about my personal life, and then start a new blog for tech stuff, use myspace for my music, etc.  However, that kind of decentralized my postings and makes it difficult to maintain each one.  The category option would allow me to use the same blog for everything, but present people with category filters to see only blogs about tech, personal, etc.  But that would mean not using blogger b\c it doesn't support that, so I'd need to find 3rd party software/develop my own to do this, including features such as categories, protecting posts and categories, etc (damn I use etc a lot, sorry).

So that's by delema ... haha, I know it's not too "delema-like", but that's what I'm calling it.  If you have an idea different than the two I presented, or have a preference of the two, please feel free to comment below; I'd like to hear what people think about this.

Anyway, like I said, I'd keep this short :-P ... goodnight.
