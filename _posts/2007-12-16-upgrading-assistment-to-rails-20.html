Today I spent some time upgraded Assistment (<a href="http://assistment.org/">http://assistment.org</a>) to Rails 2.0. I made the mistake of upgrading Rails before changing anything, and then fixing the errors one by one ... oy. So, I'll quickly go over what I had to do to get stuff working again.

</span><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:180%;">Fix deprecation warnings in 1.2.6</span></div><div>If you haven't upgraded yet, make sure you're on Rails 1.2.6 and get rid of your deprecated API calls: <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org/deprecation">http://www.rubyonrails.org/deprecation</a>. To easily find your deprecated usages grab the rake task from this site: <a href="http://www.slashdotdash.net/articles/2007/12/03/rails-2-upgrade-notes">http://www.slashdotdash.net/articles/2007/12/03/rails-2-upgrade-notes</a>. And of course, make sure your tests pass and your app actually runs before moving on!
</div><div>
Keep in mind some pretty useful parts of Rails have been pulled out into plugins, which you can find at <a href="http://svn.rubyonrails.org/rails/plugins/">http://svn.rubyonrails.org/rails/plugins/</a>. I had to install acts_as_list, acts_as_tree, classic_pagination (though, we really need to move to will_paginate!), and in_place_editing. I also had to spend time updating my forms to use the block-notation rather that start/end form tags. That was annoying.

One plugin I had trouble with was acts_as_paranoid. It calls <span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';">construct_count_options_from_legacy_args</span>, which is deprecated, but I have not found an update to the plugin. To fix it, I had to add that method to the plugin. I left the deprecation notice in there to remind me to fix it =)

Also, if you used <span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';">strip_tags</span> in you<span style="font-size:100%;">r </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;font-size:100%;" >model</span><span style="font-size:100%;"> (shush, I had my reason: I used it since I stored HTML in the database and I wanted a nice way to clean it), you have to include </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style=";font-family:'courier new';font-size:100%;"  >A</span><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';"><span style="font-size:100%;">ctionView::Helpers::SanitizeHelpe</span>r</span> in your model; just including <span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-family:'courier new';">ActionView::Helpers::TextHelper</span> won't cut it.

<pre><code>gem update rails</code></pre> should do the trick for upgrading you. I had some problems upgrading on Leopard, so I had to gem remove rails and the active*/action* gems before running "gem install rails". Even that failed the first 2 times with 404 errors for finding certain gems, but the 3rd time it worked.</div><div>
<pre><code>rake rails:update</code></pre>Run that in your project to upgrade your configs, javascripts, and scripts. I took the extra step and generated a new rails project and merged any new config changes into Assistment. This was mainly environment.rb, and the extremely useful addition of a initializers directory for application config.

</div><div><span class="Apple-style-span"  style="font-size:180%;">Running Two point Oh!</span></div><div>(Note: to use ruby-debug you don't need to manually set it up in environment.rb. Simply run ./script/server --debugger to enable debugging with the "debugger" method. Yep, that simple.)

Run your app/tests and your on Rails 2.0! If anyone has any additional issues, <a href="http://www.google.com/">google</a> is your friend.</div>
