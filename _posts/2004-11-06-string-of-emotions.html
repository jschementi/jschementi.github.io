<div class="post-content">
I look at her pictures.  I read her words.  I worry and dream about her.  I miss her and I miss her missing me ...

Almost 3 years ... I've given all that time to treating her like a princess ... and rightfully so.  She is, and she makes me feel so great when I'm with her.  But I'm not sure she loves me anymore ... but I know I can never stop.  I can't stop because I've got this constant pit ... something missing ... and I want it back.

They are together right now, and it's almost haunting.  I dream, sometimes daydream, about things that made us happy ... but it's not me, and it hurts.  But, I guess she is happy, and all-in-all that's all I want for her.  So, I guess the only think I can do is tip my hat and walk away.

Alright, before I go crazy, I'm going to go watch something southpark related ... we always enjoyed that.
