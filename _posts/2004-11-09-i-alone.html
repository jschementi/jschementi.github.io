The little things still get to me.  Seeing the relationship status in their facebook pages gave me that same alone feeling I've gotten to know so well.  I'm so happy I'm so involved during the day, I'd feel like this all the time.  

Something still doesn't sit right with me.  I remember how we acted and felt around eachother, and I know how we feel and act now ... and nothing is different.  But, it wouldn't work out right now.  I can't understand that.  I find closure in things I can understand.  Or maybe I don't want closure, so I'm not letting myself understand.  This is why CS majors aren't allowed to analyze the human psyche :-P

If a relationship isn't *real*, what's the point?  What does love mean to 2 people?  Should it mean the same thing?  What if it doesn't?  What doesn commitment mean?  Can you not be ready for it, or is it some other issue?  Can one *relationship* be based on commitment while another one isn't?  Can you love someone without commitment?  All these questions confuse me and make anny type of happiness hard.

I know you read this ... both of you.  Gino, an extremely amazing girl loves you.  If you don't wake up every morning feeling like the luckiest person in the world, you're doing something wrong.  She's a princess and deserves the best.  Also, I love her and know she deserves the best plus some, and I also trust her judgement.  Congradulations on being the best.

So, this can't be the only thing in my life, right?  True, and it's not the only thing that's fucked up either.  The GDC is taking so much work to get back on track, and so many people are just turning into dead weight.  Theta Chi has problems that I can't even get into.  And in all this, I've gotta put school first ... and I have.  But once I have an ounce of free time, all this comes as one big punch to the nose.  Yes, the secret is out.  I stay busy to forget about everything else.  It's been alot of months of this and the wear is starting to show.
