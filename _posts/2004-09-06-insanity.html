<div class="post-content">
So yeah, it's almost 2 in the morning.  I'm going to be soon, only to be woken up at 8 to work more =P.  Ah, the weekend =)

I'm pretty tired of having soo many things to do.  I have such a tough time saying no ... but I have to.  I want to stay with Tripsoft, and GDC, so those have to stay.  This new thing with Shockwave is great, but lots of work.  Schementec is my baby, so I can't leave that ... oh I know, I'll ditch that social life of partying and women ... yes that one ....

Plus, with all this work I can't set time aside to work on my room.  It's gonna have to be over a break ... or a weekend when I tell people "I'm leaving this planet!".  3 more minutes 'till 2am ...

Felicia moved up to Boston today =).  Just like we always talked about ... minus one little detail ... ... ... cough ....  She finally out of the house and at college, and I'm happy for her.  We're only a quick train ride away now, so hopefully these 7 week intervals will be cut down to at least 2 =).  ... That means I have to do my Tripsoft work on the other ones ... SEE!  Work rules my life!  We'll hopefully I'll do all this work now so I don't have to work a day in my later life.  We'll see ... as long as I have my hot girl and hot car I think I'll be set =P

2am ... right on the dot ... GOODNIGHT!
