<div class="post-content">
Today I spoke at TechReady 3, a worldwide Microsoft convention for employees. I will post about this more, but this point is just to ... well ... make a point. I also stayed at work till about 9, then went back to my apartment in Seattle and watched TV and hacked around at Starline for a while, before getting tired and wanting to go to bed. Then it hit me: I'm living in my own apartment, have a job, I go on dates rather than just jumping into relationships, I go out after work with "work friends" to the gym or for drinks ... ah! I'm grown up! Not cool, not cool.

For all those people out there who feel the same way or see their lives like this ... yeah, I don't have much to say here. Fuck, we're getting older. Ha, but I still have one more year of college :)
