<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
<p>In the last year, my team @ Microsoft hasn't really done much with <a href="http://asp.net/">ASP.NET</a>. Unfortunately so, since our focus has been on the languages themselves. Though, we have an integration with  <a href="http://silverlight.net/">Silverlight</a>, so why is ASP.NET left out?</p>  <p>That's definitely changing, 'cause now ASP.NET and Dynamic Languages are like this:</p>  <p style="text-align: center;"><a title="Best friends" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/78656792@N00/84196531/"><img alt="Best friends" src="http://bp0.blogger.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/SG6WJQKvb2I/AAAAAAAAACw/W5mEsZNprEE/s400/84196531_143245f498.jpg" border="0" /></a></p>  <p>... but, that's not to say that we did <em>nothing </em>in the last year:</p>  <h4><span style="color: rgb(255, 128, 0);">ASP.NET Futures</span></h4>  <p>In July 2007 the <a href="http://www.asp.net/Downloads/futures/">ASP.NET Futures Release</a> contained Dynamic Language Support in ASP.NET, giving you <a href="http://codeplex.com/ironpython">IronPython</a> and Managed JScript as programming languages in ASP.NET. It also had a ton of other good stuff in there, like AJAX futures, Silverlight controls, and <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Dynamic%20Data&amp;referringTitle=Home">Dynamic Data Controls</a>. If you're interested in learning more about this, take a look at the <a href="http://quickstarts.asp.net/Futures/dlr/doc/intro.aspx">Dynamic Languages in ASP.NET Quickstarts</a>.</p>  <p>The problem with this release is it's a one-off; as in <em>"who the hell knows when this stuff is going to be updated."</em> Also, IronPython releases every month, so the IronPython bits in this release were old fast. And sitting here a year later, a lot has changed! The release is really intended on being a <em>"look at what we *might* do in the future"</em>, and a year without anything substantial is way to long in our world.</p>  <p>More so, there is no support for IronRuby. Even today we're not as far along as people would hope. I have a couple "Hello, World" aspx pages using IronRuby running on my machine, but that's really the extent of it. Sucks.</p>  <p><em><strong>Shout out</strong>: Being able to use DLR languages in ASP.NET and Dynamic Data Controls are both the blood and sweat of </em><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/davidebb/"><em>David Ebbo</em></a><em>, an Architect on the ASP.NET team, and the cool guy I got to give </em><a href="http://blog.jimmy.schementi.com/2006/07/techready-3.html"><em>a talk</em></a><em> with two years ago as an intern.</em></p>  <h4><span style="color: rgb(255, 128, 0);">ASP.NET MVC</span></h4>  <p>Tangential to the whole <em>"holy crap why can't I use Iron* in ASP.NET"</em> issue is giving the <em>"</em><a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/topic/154936"><em>when is my IronRuby going to be in ASP.NET MVC</em></a><em>"</em> drones something to chew on. And at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/events/teched2008/developer/default.mspx">TechEd 2008</a>, <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/">John Lam</a> gave them some slivers of meat: </p>  <p><a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/06/ironruby-and-aspnet-mvc.html">IronRuby and ASP.NET MVC</a>. Also, <a href="http://haacked.com/">Phil Haack</a> followed up with a <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2008/06/12/ironruby-and-asp.net-bffs-forever.aspx">IronRuby and ASP.NET BFFs Forever</a> post. Yes, very cute.  =) </p>  <p>Anyway, no real bits are out there yet for this, but we do have proof for ourselves that ASP.NET MVC aren't doing things that alienate DLR languages. Woohoo! Now it's just a matter of doing it right and getting it out the door.</p>  <h4><span style="color: rgb(255, 128, 0);">Next stop: the Web Server</span></h4>  <p>Today we run on the client, which can be represented by cmd.exe/WPF/WinForms, as well in Firefox/Internet Explorer/Safari with <a href="http://codeplex.com/sdlsdk">Silverlight</a>. However, the web server has been fairly uncharted by us. This is what we're changing. </p>  <p>Really, this whole post is about DLR Languages and the web server. The DLR in ASP.NET and ASP.NET MVC (yes, they are different. yes, it's confusing).</p>  <p>But it extends past Microsoft web frameworks. At <a href="http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008">RailsConf 2008</a> <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/">John Lam</a> showed <a href="http://www.iunknown.com/2008/05/ironruby-and-rails.html">IronRuby running Rails</a>, and I showed integrating Ruby on Rails with Silverlight to nicely have Ruby on the server and the client (more information on the plugin soon).</p>  <p>It's all about making the Microsoft platform, being Windows or Silverlight, valuable to developers.</p>  <h4><span style="color: rgb(255, 128, 0);">Next steps</span></h4>  <p>All this kind of leaves you, the dude/dudette trying to get something done, at a loss, since any bits we have are a year old, and with all these pretty words, I've given you nothing but some continued hope. Wow, I'm cynical.</p>  <p>Not really sure about what's next, other than a ton of coffee with David and other folks on the ASP.NET team, trying to figure out how to get this stuff into your hands. We're pretty addicted to <a href="http://codeplex.com/">Codeplex</a>, so I'm pretty sure it'll find it's way there. However, we need to finish building it, so that's got to happen first. Again, that will be more coffee. Or <a href="http://www.odwalla.com/">expensive juice</a>, I've been hooked on that stuff. </p>  <p>So, with that, all I've got to say is "Stay Tuned" =)</p>
