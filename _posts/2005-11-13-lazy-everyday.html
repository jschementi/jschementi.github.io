<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
So yesterday we had a social and I dragged my ass around the house on crutches, ugh, I was exausted by the end of the night.  I had fun, but everyone thought I was all upset and cranky, which I was a little, but I guess that's the vibe you get from a guy with a busted-up foot.

Today I woke up late, ate day-old pizza cause that's what is in my room, and studied for bio.  Ya know, it's not that I want to do anything, it's that I don't even have the choice to.  ::sigh::  Anyway, my foot isn't getting much better, so hopefully the health center will have something to say to be tomorrow ... probably not.  Grr, i'm just not myself, and it seems that no one is here to help.  ::sigh::

Here's a random thought thought.  The word "Everyday", that means "all days", so "every" means "all", does that mean I can say Wednes or Satur and have those mean once a week?  OK that makes no sense, i'm gonna shut up.

Ok, better suck it up and study so I can graduate ....
