This apple/webcam incompatibility issue pisses me off. For god sakes, you ship a webcam built into your laptops! If you are so fond of "choice", please work with other companies to make sure their hardware is compatible with yours.

There is a solution on the horizon though; <a href="http://webcam-osx.sourceforge.net/">macam</a>. It is a driver for USB webcams on Mac                OS X. Here's <a href="http://webcam-osx.sourceforge.net/cameras/index.php">a list</a> of the currently supported webcams. My QuickCam 5000 is on the "in progress" list, so hopefully it'll work! Anyway, check it out, and if you're a computery person with free time, help them out with making your camera work on Mac OS X.
