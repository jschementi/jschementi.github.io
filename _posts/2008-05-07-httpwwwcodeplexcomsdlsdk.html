<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
So, now that the storm is over and I can talk about this without cursing ...

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jschementi/2472826906/" title="Dynamic Languages on Silverlight.net by jschementi, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2277/2472826906_4411c4397b_m.jpg" width="240" height="136" alt="Dynamic Languages on Silverlight.net" /></a>

The beautiful <a href="http://dynamicsilverlight.net">Dynamic Silverlight website</a> now redirects to <a href="http://silverlight.net/learn/dynamiclanguages.aspx">Silverlight.net</a>. I guess it's best to have all Silverlight content in one place, so I was approached about a month ago to move the content off of dynamicsilverlight.net. In the end, I'm all for more exposure, so hopefully this helps more people learn about dynamic languages in Silverlight.

At the same time, marketing @ Microsoft became very <b>interested</b> in the name "Dynamic Silverlight", and quickly re-named it to "Silverlight Dynamic Languages SDK". That's way too long, so I just call it <b>sdlsdk</b> ... I like how it <b>clunks</b> off the tougue. So, the Codeplex site link has been changed from /dynamicsilverlight to /sdlsdk, and dynamic-silverlight.zip has changed to sdl-sdk.zip. C'est la vie.

Good news though: Managed JScript is now part of <b>sdlsdk</b>, so no longer will you have to grab the Silverlight SDK simply for an out-dated version of JScript that can only play with itself. (Note: You'll still need the SDK if you want to understand any error messages, but that's changing in Silverlight 2 Beta 2).

Over and out.
