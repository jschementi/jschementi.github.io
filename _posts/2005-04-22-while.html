<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
So ... it's been almost a month since my last post ... woohoo for being retartedly busy. I'm trying to figure out where I'm gonna be this summer, and what's going on with me now, and all I can describe it as is "confusion". I've got either GE, Sun, IBM, or SMPL for this summer ... I guess we'll see.

Oh, and my birthday was a couple days ago ... woohoo for being 21 :-). Felicia came to visit on Monday; we went to dinner at Biagio's and then dissert at Cafe Dolce. The next day my parents came here and we all went to lunch at Vinny T's, and then brought Felicia to catch her train at 5:30 ... train goodbyes are always soo cute =). My parents left soon after ... and that was my birthday. I then proceded to realize how much work I have ... and drowned myself in it again.

I spent all of today at Friendly House putting running cable in their drop ceiling ... oy. I'll be done soon ... It'll be done soon.

AI is a crazy class ... lots of work that I'm not going to be able to finish :-P We'll see.

Other than that ... I just wish we were a certain way ... but i guess "I have nothing to worry about". There may be someone else out there for me ... but right know I she is the right person for me ... and I'm not going to let that possibility ruin this. Even if, such a long history can't compare to meeting someone new. There's no one else like you, and even if there is ... you were here first =) ... and that "possibility" shouldn't hold us back. That's what love means to me.

However, my birthday was amazing, and what you do and say really means a lot to me. It makes me feel special =).

Now time to get drunk
