Here's the main part of the article:

"The AP reports that AOL, Yahoo, Microsoft, EarthLink, NetZero and Juno are teaming up to fight child pornography. They are pooling together $1 million to build a database of pornographic images of children and software to match the image database with similar matches on their own networks. So Yahoo may scan email attachments, Yahoo Groups images and other places in the Yahoo network where images may be. If any of the images match an image in the database, it can be flagged and sent to the authorities. The exact details of the software and how it will be used have not yet been decided."

Are you kidding me? Building a central location for this stuff is beyond stupid. If applications can use this site to check if a image is pornographic, I'm 100% sure others will start using it's content to fuel their own websites. Damn, 6 huge internet companies will be fueling the content ... it's like these sicko's biggest dream come true.  Ugh, freaken idiots ...
