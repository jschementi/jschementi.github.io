<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
The mind wanders this late, and comes up with some funny things.  And no, this is not inspired from a Bob Dylan song.  Today I put up this away message:

<span style="font-style: italic;">"Back in the day cool kids were doing drugs, listening to rock and roll, and  having unprotected sex ... because they didn't know any better. These days, kids  download music illegally for fun."</span>

My high-self thought this up and also though it sounded great, but now my drunk self questions its meaning.  Is this generation really full of losers?

<span style="font-size:130%;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Where is all this coming from?</span></span>

This idea spawns from my past 4 years where things really did a 180 in my life.  Coming from a high school where I'm a pseudo-popular kid, but still have friends and an abundance of teen romance, my college years saw a much different story.  Late nights working, dwelling on the same fading relationship, and struggling with my peak hormones in a world of your "below the bar" quality looks ... sorry, I'm really not that shallow but I've gotta be physically attracted to the other person.  Joining Theta Chi was my saving grace at that school ... but it made me question, "If I'm what people see as cool, what does that say for them"?

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-size:130%;">Outside the bubble</span></span>

We always wanted to get out of the "bubble" ...  meaning my hometown.  After 4 years, I can safely say life was better inside.  Real word people dealing with real life, not lines of code or circuits or developing games for fun.  That quote was inspired by a generation change, meaning that in the 70's people were more care-free than today and less controlled by technology, but I see now it more-so reflects my life; not exactly with the drugs and sex and all, but figuratively.  Back in the day, if I got dumped I moved on to the next girl that was "waiting in line" ... but now I look around and say "I'm gonna sweat blood to stay with you since there's nothing else here".

<span style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-size:130%;">Get it back to good?</span></span>

This time the song quote makes sense ... how do I get it back?  There I go, being over-analytical again :).  Today in the shower (which is where I make all my revelations ... unlike most people's favorite place, the toilet) I told myself "I'm done with all this and ready to move on", and I didn't get the all-to-familiar urge to say "no no no, you're crazy".  That felt good.  I'm living in a new state this summer and I guess I see all this as an opportunity to test out this new vibe I've got.

To be honest, I don't know what's going to happen ... but I really want to be happy, and that's all that matters to me now.
