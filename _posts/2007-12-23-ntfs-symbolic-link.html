Yes, that was a lot of small hates.</p>  <p>Vista now supports symbolic/hard links like POSIX systems do (*nix, bsd, etc). This is amazing, as I use them like crazy on my Ubuntu and Leopard machines.</p>  <p>It's as easy as:    <br /><code></code></p>  <p><code>C:\&gt;mklink /d bar c:\windows</code></p>  <p><code></code>More info: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_symbolic_link">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS_symbolic_link</a> </p>  <p>I stumbled upon this while trying to set up the Zune software and iTunes (on Leopard) to pull from the same music library ... on yet another machine. On Leopard, I simply put a symlink to where my music library is mapped, so it looked something like this: </p>  <p><code>$/Users/jimmy&gt;ln -s /Volumes/jimmy/Music/iTunes Music/iTunes</code></p>  <p><code></code>This requires I have my shared library mounted to that volume already, so I created a little <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automator_%28software%29">automator</a> script to mount <code>smb://jimmy-zeus/jimmy</code> to <code>/Volumes/jimmy</code>. </p>  <p>In Vista, this is simply one step. You can make the symlink directly to a SMB file-share! (Please someone correct me if you can do this in *nix ... I'll promise to feel like an idiot =P). </p>  <p><code>C:\Users\jimmysch&gt;mklink /D iTunes <a href="file://\\jimmy-zeus\jimmy\Music\iTunes\iTunes Music">\\jimmy-zeus\jimmy\Music\iTunes\iTunes Music</a></code></p>  <p><code></code>Pretty freakin' cool!</p>  <p>[Update] Ok, maybe SMB file-share symlinks aren't so cool; as explorer.exe doesn't understand them and will hang the UI if the server doesn't respond right away when navigating to a folder with <strong>ANY SMB SYMLINK'd FOLDERS!</strong> And if you don't have access to the server ... you must wait for the 60 second timeout to get control of the window again. Ugh. Use wisely ...</p>
