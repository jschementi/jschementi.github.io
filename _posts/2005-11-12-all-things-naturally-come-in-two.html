<div class="post-content">
Whoa, 60th post!!! Woohoo! yeah, anyway ...

So we're 2 weeks into B-term. The leaves start falling, temperature starts dropping, and ankles start spraining ... wait, again? Yes again. But, it's my other ankle, so now I have no good ankles, sweeeet. It happened playing basketball, again, landing on someone elses foot and turning my ankle. All I know, I've gotta buy really really hi-tops. Like, Reebok Pumps ... ha!

Anyway, I'm finally caught up with work and now that I'm injured I'm just sitting on my ass and not doing an damn thing. Also I'm growing a beard, 'cause I can't stand up much longer than to take a shower in the morning, no time to shave/gel/etc. I thought my other ankle would hurt much more, but it doesn't ... it just get's really tiring to hop around on it/use crutches.

Yeah, I try to post once a week, but that sometimes doesn't work out. I'll try to keep the promise :) Ok so I want to watch Comedy Central now.
