<p><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">UPDATE: </span><a href='http://www.mediafour.com/products/macdrive/' target="_blank">MacDrive 8</a> has been released, which has support for Windows 7, so the work-around explained in this post is no longer necessary. Also, people have been experiencing issues with it, so my advice is to upgrade.</p><hr /><p>If you’re running Windows on a Mac, and you’re shuffling files between Mac OS and Windows, <a href="http://www.mediafour.com/products/macdrive/" target="_blank">MacDrive</a> is the best tool for mounting your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_File_System" target="_blank">HFS</a> (Mac OS’s default file-system format) partitions in Windows. MacDrive costs $49.95, but is well worth it. However, MacDrive does not release versions for pre-release operating systems, and there are a couple speed bumps when trying to use MacDrive on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/" target="_blank">Windows 7</a>. There are various version of this solution posted in a bunch of forums, but no definitive guide. Here’s exactly how I solved it:</p><p>1. <font color="#ff8000"><strong>MacDrive’s installer will only run on Windows XP and Vista</strong></font>. To have it run on Windows 7, you must run as Administrator, run in “Windows Vista” compatibility mode.</p><p>2.<font color="#ff8000"><strong> Also remove the operating system version checks the installer makes with </strong></font><a href="http://www.technipages.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/orca.Msi" target="_blank"><strong><font color="#8080ff">Orca</font></strong></a>. MacDrive’s installer is an self-extracting exe, so you must extract it first; using <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank">7-zip</a> or any other unzipping tool will do the trick. Once extracted launch Orca and open MacDrive/x86.en-US/MacDrive7.x86.en-US.msi (or the x64 version if that applies to you). Once open, look for the “LaunchCondition” table and delete all rows from it.</p><p>3. If you run the main setup.exe from the extracted location it will install fine, but upon reboot you will not see your Mac OS drive. This is because <font color="#ff8000"><strong>MacDrive simply doesn’t assign the drive a letter</strong></font>. To do so, download <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ext2fsd/Ext2Fsd-0.46a.zip?download">Ext2Fsd</a>, unzip, and run Ext2Mgr.exe. Find your HFSJ-formatted partition, right-click and select “Change Drive Letter”. Assign it a letter, exit the application.</p><p><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/Sgno57PMYbI/AAAAAAAAAI0/Yy1xawEql14/s1600-h/image%5B9%5D.png"><img style="display: inline" title="image" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/Sgno6CGWVOI/AAAAAAAAAI4/8kkXsWdsOg8/image_thumb%5B5%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="400" height="323" /></a> </p><p>4. <font color="#ff8000"><strong>Open up your “Computer” screen and you should see your Mac OS drive now:</strong></font></p><p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/Sgno6dgnxaI/AAAAAAAAAI8/e4X5uluVjkA/s1600-h/image%5B15%5D.png"><img style="display: inline" title="image" alt="image" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_OqCZhp9yI0Q/Sgno6tQIlfI/AAAAAAAAAJA/bxQwAoLZ_G4/image_thumb%5B9%5D.png?imgmax=800" width="400" height="62" /></a> </p><p>Please post in the comments if this doesn’t work for you, and I’ll update the steps.

    The next version of Mac OS X (code name "Snow Leopard") will include HFS+ drivers with BootCamp.  Not sure if they'll make the drives available separately for use in a VM though...

    @Jesse<br /><br />You need to restart your computer after installing MacDrive. If you don't, Ext2Mgr will still thing it's a RAW drive.

    You can also use the disk management tool that&#39;s built into windows to assign a drive letter. Anyway, this is not the problem. Macdrive is still not working after this, I&#39;m on build 7264 btw.

    Jimmy could you please explain a little more about what you did with Orca?  What do you mean by delete all the rows of &quot;LaunchCondition&quot;?  Thanks.
