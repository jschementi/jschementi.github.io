<p><a title="Live Mesh Logo" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/24458122@N00/2590440231/"><img border="0" alt="Live Mesh Logo" src="http://static.flickr.com/3044/2590440231_0d953a6379_m.jpg" /></a></p>  <p>Today my three machines (2 Vista and 1 XP) which use <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Live_Core">Live Mesh</a> asked to be updated. No information to what the updates include ... just that they wanted to plug back into the mother ship. I thought, &quot;Could this be, the infamous Live Mesh update that removes the need for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUPxkzV1RTc">UAC</a>&quot;? After updating my Vista machines, I <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/disable-user-account-control-uac-the-easy-way-on-windows-vista/">disabled UAC</a>, rebooted, and ... Live Mesh still worked fine! Woohoo!</p>  <p>This should now convince more people to <a href="https://www.mesh.com/Welcome/Welcome.aspx">install and use Live Mesh</a>.</p>  <p>PS: I searched the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes">tubes</a> for any announcement of this awesome update, and found nothing. Nothing. <a href="http://www.christopherprice.net/live-mesh-updated-no-uac-required-371.html">This guy</a> had the same experience. However, today (a day after the update) at 11:30a a blog entry appeared on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/">Live Mesh blog</a> announcing the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/livemesh/archive/2008/06/18/service-update-new-build-released-2815-17.aspx">service update</a>.</p>  <p>Now, I suffer from the same delay-between-release-and-blogging syndrome that most project owners suffer from, but all projects are expected to have some explanation of what the release contains ... like release notes, etc. Live Mesh uses there blog as the release notes, so they have more of a <strong>need</strong> to be on-top of their blog<strong>. </strong></p>

    Umm, no.<BR/><BR/>[UAC]: You are typing a message @mge, Cancel or Allow?<BR/><BR/>Allow ... anyway, like I was saying, I don't run with UAC because I don't want to be treated like a toddler when using my computer. I'm old enough to know what things I shouldn't chew on or stick into sockets. I run as a normal user on my Ubuntu and Mac machines because I hardly ever have to use root, compared to the number of times UAC will get in my way during the course of a day.<BR/><BR/>Also, I use synergy to share my keyboard and mouse across multiple machines, and with UAC turned on synergy runs in user-UI space, where anything running elevated runs in administrator-UI space. So, I can't grab those windows with the mouse :(
