<p><img src="https://seattle.codecamp.us/images/CodeCampBanner.jpg" width="382" height="94" /> </p>  <p>I just finished speaking at <a href="https://seattle.codecamp.us/">Seattle CodeCamp v4.0</a> about dynamic languages in <a href="http://silverlight.net">Silverlight</a>, titled <a href="https://seattle.codecamp.us/sessions.aspx#Browser+meet+Ruby+and+Python">Browser, Meet Ruby and Python</a>. Here's my abstract:</p>  <blockquote>   <p>People entrenched in Visual Studio all day [sometimes] forget how powerful a command-line and a text-editor can be. Remember, these are the *tools* that built and continue-to-build the web. With nothing else up my sleeves (I wear short sleeves) I'll build a cool web applications with <a href="http://ironruby.net">IronRuby</a>, <a href="http://codeplex.com/ironpython">IronPython</a>, <a href="http://codeplex.com/aspnet">ASP.NET MVC</a>, and <a href="http://silverlight.net">Silverlight</a>, and show you why scripting/dynamic languages are powerful and productive tools.</p> </blockquote>  <p>Of course, that didn't end up being my exact talk, but close enough. I talked about REPL's, <a href="http://ironruby.net">IronRuby</a>, <a href="http://silverlight.net">Silverlight</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/marchange/444184871/">Hippies</a>. Here are the <a href="http://jimmy.schementi.com/downloads/seattle-code-camp-v4.0/seattle-code-camp-2008-11-16.pptx">slides</a> (<em>rename it to pptx since my web server is reporting it as a zip mime-type</em>), but I'll be making subsequent posts about the specific things I showed. Stay tuned!</p>

    Jimmy, the slide deck is nice, but sort of minimal. I guess you had a lot of demos to do. :)<BR/>I get a lot of questions on "why would I choose dynamic language over C#"... I think that most ASP.NET developers don't 'see' the benefits of using python/ruby/jscript as their backend... How do you explain such questions? Why would one use python rather C# as a 'code behind' for Silverlight? (other than language preference, mind you! :)).

    @miha, Yep, I hate slides =) Posts are coming ...<BR/><BR/>Most developers don't see the benefit because they don't understand dynamic languages. And that's fine, because they may love the language their using.<BR/><BR/>Some developers prefer a very lightweight development method, and Python or Ruby gives that to you ... as in you don't "need" a large IDE to do all your work in.<BR/><BR/>The "why dynamic languages" topic is a book in itself, so the only way for a programmer to make an educated decision is to try one of these langauges for themselves. Or watch a screencast, those always win people over.
