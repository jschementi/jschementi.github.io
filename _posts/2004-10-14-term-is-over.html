Woohoo!  A-term is over!  The craziest term ever; so much work and homeless for half of it =P  Dispite that, I think I did really well ... and now time for vacation! ... from school anyway ;)

Last night I went to bed around 12AM (crazy early, i know!) ... but that's just b\c Mike made me since I didn't sleep the night before.  Except, I woke up at 6:30AM to study for my 9AM final ;).  There's a catch to everything.  After my final I chilled out for an hour ... then prepared for my 11:40 OOAD Project Presentation.  That went really well; i guess i'm really good at selling complete pieces of shit.  Then i gave my professor back his fixed and upgraded computer, and then studied for his final ... hehe.  After that (OOAD) final, my A-term happily became history ...

I'm still not sure what I'm doing until I go home ... actually I'm not sure when I'm going home =P.  I may stay in Boston for a little bit ... I may just stay here for a bit ... I may not stay anywhere and go home ... but I know I'll be bored out of mind very very quick there.  Hopefully I can get to Boston.
