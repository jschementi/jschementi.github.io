<p align="center"><img style="border: 0px" src="http://jimmy.schementi.com/downloads/agdlr-400.png" width="240" height="101" /> </p><p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://codeplex.com/sdlsdk">&quot;Silverlight Dynamic Languages SDK&quot; Codeplex project</a> has existed since March 2008, with signed binary releases and source code drops every month or so. Though it's a good ship vehicle for the Silverlight+DLR integration, it's not really an open source project -- mainly as it lacks a public source repository. That changes today.</p><p style="padding-bottom: 10px; padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px; padding-top: 10px" align="center"><span style="border-bottom: gray 1px solid; border-left: gray 1px solid; padding-bottom: 5px; background-color: #333; padding-left: 5px; padding-right: 5px; border-top: gray 1px solid; border-right: gray 1px solid; padding-top: 5px"><a href="http://github.com/jschementi/agdlr"><font size="5"><strong>AgDLR</strong> Source Repository</font></a></span></p><p align="left">This repository will contain the sources to Microsoft.Scripting.Silverlight.dll and Chiron.exe, as well as Ruby/Python libraries for writing Silverlight applications. Any &quot;feature&quot; work on those pieces of code will be committed to the public repository first, and eventually make its way into MIcrosoft's internal source control so the DLR/Iron* languages don't break it. This repository takes a binary dependency on the Iron* languages as well as the DLR, since this isn't the place to change that code. The source code for <a href="http://ironruby.rubyforge.org/svn/trunk/">IronRuby</a>, <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/IronPython/SourceControl/ListDownloadableCommits.aspx">IronPython</a>, and the <a href="http://www.codeplex.com/dlr">DLR</a> are available elsewhere, but releases on the <a href="http://codeplex.com/sdlsdk">Codeplex page for this project</a> will still contain source drops of everything.</p><p align="center"><img style="background-color: white; margin: 5px" src="http://markelikalderon.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/octocat.png" width="210" height="210" /> </p><p>The repository is hosted on <a href="http://github.com">http://github.com</a>, which is a collaborative development site based around <a href="http://git.or.cz/">git</a>, a &quot;fast, efficient, distributed version control system ideal for the collaborative development of software&quot;. You can browse the sources on the website, look at <a href="http://github.com/jschementi/agdlr/commit/f7e4b6a22974209600b6b95a8126bf63db0cdcf6">commits</a>, <a href="http://github.com/jschementi/agdlr/fork">fork</a> your own version of the repository, or just <a href="http://github.com/jschementi/agdlr/zipball/master">download a snapshot</a>. If you're new to git, just install it (<a href="http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/list">for windows, see here</a>, <a href="http://git.debuggable.com/screencasts/2:using_git_on_windows">and here</a>). If you'd like to learn more about Github, or Git, <a href="http://github.com/guides/home">Github guides</a> is a good place to start.</p><p>If you'd like to contribute to AgDLR, fork your own version of the repository, commit your changes to your version, and send me a <a href="http://github.com/guides/pull-requests">pull request</a> on github. We'll take it from there.</p><p>I've already started to work on a new feature which I talked about at Seattle CodeCamp, but that's the next post.</p>
