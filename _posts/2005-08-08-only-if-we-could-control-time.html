This is my last week at GE. As much as I complain about work these past 11 weeks have been great. All the interns get along great and we've had our share of crazy nights out. Despite the "Stead" being a crazy house and our internet problems, getting to know the other interns living there has been cool. On the flip side, it's been an interesting taste of what I don't want to do with my life. Here I feel like nothing I do could possibly make a difference. I aid in the communication between people who need software and the offshore developers making it. We only have like 2 hours to talk to them, so how can it be cheaper!? I was proposed with outsourcing in my own company, and I'm so happy I turned it down. The only time I feel like I made a difference is the volunteer project Garrett and I did, and according to the high-ups "this is not typical GE". Great, that makes me feel so much better.

So, my website is actually going to be done! It's gonna have my music, blog, portfolio, and a bunch of other things on it ... it'll be sweet. <a href="http://jimmy.schementi.com/">http://jimmy.schementi.com/</a> .. check it out! With "The company formally known as Schementec", I'm juggling to clients websites and a restaurant application ... so that's keeping me busy. I really want this to take off, but I haven't met anyone with my ambition ... story of my life. Oh well, in the meantime I need a new name! Comment on this if you've got one!

School starts in less than 2 weeks, so I'm scrambling to catch up on Theta Chi money and web stuff, and GDC web/everything stuff. I've also gotta plan out my schedule ... yeah, haven't done that yet. So, I'm pretty sure I'm staying on for masters, so that complicates things more. I really need to not sleep for a week and just get all this stuff done. :(

I'm so happy Felicia is recovering fully. I saw her yesterday after not seeing her for a week and I was so happy she was walking. It's been a crazy 2 weeks but she's got her life back and I've got her back! Wrapping my mind around this whole thing has been really hard, but it's really made me think a lot; life is too short so make sure the people you love know you feel that way.
