This weekend was parents weekend, so a lot of families and fun things to do around campus. One of the silly things about this year was we had an activities fair during Parent's weekend; I know I wouldn't have taken my parents to that! Anyway, it's just another way the school is showing off for the parents, oh well.

Yeah, I know you wish you were the goat.

So today was the beginning of Greek week, and kicking everything off was the greek olympics ... complete with giant beiruit and human pyramids. We didn't do too well, but it was fun none-the-less.
