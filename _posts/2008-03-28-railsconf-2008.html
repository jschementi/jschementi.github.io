</a>Just registered today! I don't have a talk there, but I may tag-team it up w/<a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.iunknown.com">John Lam</a> to show off our Rails integration ... IronRuby on the server, and IronRuby on the client =)

I'm also trying to talk the <a href="http://assistment3.cs.wpi.edu/">Assistment</a> guys into coming along, hopefully they can.

Anyway, it's kinda cool that I'm going, especially since Rails is this word that will always remind me of the thing that kept me doing what I'm doing. I'm sure this is true for so many others out there. So thanks, and see you all soon.
