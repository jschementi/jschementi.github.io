My flight was yesterday, and it was delayed for 6ish hours between boarding and takeoff. Oy! I fell asleep for 2 hours on the plane and woke up still on the ground ... not a good feeling. My luggage was the first off the carousel though, which was pretty much the highlight of my day. =P

I'm staying at the Villa Appia apartments, the same place I stayed last year. Though it is technically in Seattle, I eventually want to move to Seattle "proper" ... like the city.

I start work @ Microsoft in a week, so I have time now to shop around for a car. Ok, time to unpack. =)

Here's some pictures of my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jschementi/tags/villaappia/">"temporary" apartment</a>:
