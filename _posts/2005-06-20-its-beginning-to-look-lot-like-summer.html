Here's the GE group having a Thursday night out.
(Right to left: ?, Tony, Garrett, Remy, Kendra, Colleen)

So yeah, this weekend has come and gone as well =( ... but it was fun. Not quite as relaxing as I wanted to, but I did get to enjoy a beer and cigar with Felicia and her dad :-P.

What else did I do this weekend ... hmm ... oh! I also climbed a tree:

Yep, this is me in a tree ...

Wow, I've shown myself all grown up and then like a little kid again.  I guess that suites my current state of mind this weekend since I've been going through old moves of my sister and I for her graduation party ... so yeah, I'm pretty nostalgic.
