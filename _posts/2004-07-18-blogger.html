<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
For the time being, I'm transfering my blogging power over to Blogger. I know, I know, but I don't have time to work on my publishing website, and I need a way to publish =P. 

I'm currently working on my homepage and a script to put all my posts from iweblog.net into this blog. The trick is fitting that in with a full time job, a startup business, and a personal life. Woopdy freaken doo. 

I've moved my homepage to http://www.iweblog.net/~jimmy/BROKEN, just so I could have a nice way to access my blog. Eventually each section of my site will be subdomained, so accessing my blog will be at jimmy.iweblog.net/blog, and my pictures will be at jimmy.iweblog.net/pictures, etc. Or, I might just get another domain (like, something to do with my name), and post there. Then it would be blog.somedomain.com, or pictures.somedomain.com ... I like that better =P 

Anyway, this is my blog now.
