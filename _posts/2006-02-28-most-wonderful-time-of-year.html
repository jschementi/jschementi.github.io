So, Worcester is snowey and freezing, I have 18 billion things due this week, and projects are getting more hectic.  It's 1am and I'm stopping one project that I haven't finished yet to start another I haven't started yet... and I started listening to Dashboard ... so you can infer this isn't that cool ...

So Thursday's the last day of undergrad classes, and then I can relax, a little...not.  Then I start working on POS again, my Compilers project, MQP cleanup stuff, and anything else I've been slacking on.

In all this poppy crappy news, there is some good ... Sean's wedding is March 11th <span style="font-weight: bold;">and</span> Allison and I are going! :)  It's gonna be a fun experience, with all the driving and weddingness partying.  I'm sure I'll have oodles of pictures.

Oh, and my hair ... yeah, what should I do?  Cut it back to what it used to be, just trim it and keep it long, or totally shave my head?  Comment away.
