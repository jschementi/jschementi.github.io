<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
I've come to the understanding that if you ignore something, you probably shouldn't fight it. This blog is uninteresting, unthemed, and well ... boring. But, I still find it important to talk about me! This has actually turned into a journal, and a blog and a journal are 2 completely different things! I'll keep posting here just about personal stuff until I can get a categorized blog, and then all will finally be harmonious.

Anyway, work is crazy, I'm moving to Seattle soon, and all is fun. I just spend the weekend in Olympic National Park and took plenty of pictures, go check them out. I'm working on a new prototype of POS and it gives me much more faith that'll I'll push this thing out.

Tomorrow's kind of an important day, so I should get to sleep.
