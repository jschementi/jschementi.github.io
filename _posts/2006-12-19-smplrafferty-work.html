<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
So pretty much right on cue, I've got a couple web design projects. Sean Martens is thinking of renaming his company, so I'm doing the website/logo work for him. I might hire someone else to do it, but we'll see how busy I get. Plus, another Rafferty company needs a website as well. Not off to a bad start ...
