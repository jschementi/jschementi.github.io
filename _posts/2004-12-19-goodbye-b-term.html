Whoa .... so after 49 hours of not sleeping, B-term is over! This was a hard term, and now things tend to get interesting for me =P

The Theta Chi Formal was Friday night (12/17). It was really good; everyone seemed to have a blast. I think I took about 90 pictures ... yeah. The afterparty was also cool, since we decorated the house and had hot coco and eggnog. Good times.

I took the train home, being discusted with the greyhound service. Felicia and a friend from school accompanied me, so the ride wasn't bad at all. Even though I have to take the train into Boston, it's not that bad. All trains, none of this bus business :-P Last night I went to bed at 10PM, and I woke up this morning at 12PM! A whole 14 hrs; I definately caught up on my sleep =P.

Today, I've really only gotta help set up our christmas tree, and other things I may want to do; like finishing my site =P. I will most likely work with Sean this break, so I won't be that "unbusy" (woohoo for making up words).

OK, time to do something else.
