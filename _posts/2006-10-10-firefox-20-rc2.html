<div class="post-content">
So I downloaded this early adopter version of Firefox, and my del.icio.us browser extension doesn't work, wah! So, I had to resort back to the browser buttons for now. Anyway, it looks basically the same, the graphics are a little faded, making it hard for me to know whether something was enabled or disabled, but the other UI changes look OK. 2.0 doesn't look that much different than anything else, but we'll see what happens when it's actually released.

Maybe I'll elaborate on this ... we'll see. Oh wow, I just noticed another cool feature; they have spell checking enabled in textfields! Or is this a new blogger feature?
