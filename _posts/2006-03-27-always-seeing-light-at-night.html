<div class="post-content">
I've really got to get back on a normal sleep schedule ... the last couple nights I go to sleep right at the sun comes up, oy.

So a lot has happened over the past month, and I really need to finish my website to update on stuff more.  I'm presenting about Ruby on Rails tomorrow for STTG, and pretty excited about it.  I'm also working on my MQP presentation and finishing all that stuff up, which is cool.

This <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/about.html">guy</a> is my new idol ...

I fly out to Seattle on the 14th of April, so I'm pretty excited about that.  Hopefully I'll be interviewing with a good team of at Microsoft.

Ok it's 5am, this is crazy, I better go to sleep.
