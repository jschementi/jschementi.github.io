<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
So, C-term came to a close last Thursday and I couldn't be happier.  Right after my classes I packed up and headed to Boston to see Felicia for a couple of days before heading home together.  But since I was so excited to see her I left a couple necessities back at school, like shower shoes, all my chargers, and my laptop!  Luckely Felicia is wonderful and let me take her laptop home with me to use ... i love this lappy!  Anywho, it was a fun weekend spent hanging out, swiping me in and out of her dorm, and $5 movies =).  It was a great close to a hell-of-c-term.

The trip home on Sunday morning was also great.  Coffee and a busride with Felicia and company was nice ... we actually made amazing time of 4 hours!  Peter Pan deserves a pat on the back for that one.  Felicia brought her roommate home with her for the vacation, so it's fun watching her learn all about NY and Long Island.  Monday night (I think) we went to play pool at Raxx; 3 girls v.s. me is fun =P.  

So yeah, I've also gotten a bunch of stuff done this break.  Finished 2 MSBS projects (graphics and ooad), finished a web design for a client, and I'm now starting on my own homepage!  I know, about freaken time!  The plan is to get all the content up with a suitable layout, and then add content and new layouts as time goes on.  Woohoo, and all from a lll' 12-inch PowerBook! =)

Ok, back to work!

(Note to self: put up pictures of the break and of the laptop!)
