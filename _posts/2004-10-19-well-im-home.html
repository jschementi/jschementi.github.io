<div class="post-content">
Saturday morning I woke up and thought, "Yeah, I should probably go home."  I finally got smart and packed all my clothes into my hiking backpack ... made it ALOT easier to carry.  Also, I thought I was gonna miss my bus b\c I called YellowCab at 2 o'clock ... but right when I hung up the phone I heard the cab honking outside.  Super service =P. 

I got a 2:35pm bus from Worcester and got into NYC around 6:30pm.  As usual, I took the walk from Port Authority to Penn Station and got a 7:15pm train to New Hyde Park.  There was a really cute baby (maybe 7 months old) on the train who kept staring at me ... so the first 20 minutes of my train ride consisted of playing peek-a-boo.  :-)

Last night I went over the Cutrone's to help them with computer issues.  It was strange not having Felicia there, but I watched the Yankees game with them.  They also fed me =) ... it's always nice going over there, and it was nice seeing them again. 

I've got alot of work to do this week, and I'm taking a break right now since I'm doing laundry ... yeah cause that whole bag I packed was dirty =P.
