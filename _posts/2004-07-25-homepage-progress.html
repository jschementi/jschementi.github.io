Ok, I officially hate Windows Internet Explorer. I just finished a new layout, and since IE doesn't "easily" support PNG Transparency, I was in for some crappy times. Microsoft thinks it's acceptable to make you use a DirectX filter, and then find a way to get other browsers to render it correctly, rather than follow the standards and make developers happy. 

IE makes you do this: 
<code>
background-image: url(images/layout/jimmy_navigation.png); 
background-repeat: no-repeat; 
_background-image: none; 
_filter:progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.AlphaImageLoader(src='images/layout/jimmy_navigation.png', sizingMethod='scale'); 
</code>
instead of just the first 2 lines.  And on top of that, depending on the size of your image, links placed over them may not be clickable!  That's a pretty ugly bug, and I haven't been able to figure out a fix for it yet (other than using a 1px width image).

Anyway, other than this web dev madness, I'm working on various programming/computer projects ... and cleaning my house.  Hopefully I'll get out of the house sometime today.
