My Microsoft internship ended with a bang on Aug 25th. I ended up making a Rubik Cube demo game for IronPython, and creating identical webapps in varing technologies to compare and contrast Ruby on Rails to ASP.NET. Fun stuff! I presented my findings to the CLR team on my 2nd to last day, and then I presented again to the ASP.NET team the following day! I had a blast and got to share my ideas with a lot of really smart people. AND I got published in MSDN Magazine! Here's the article:

Overall, it was a great summer, but I was so happy to be coming home. The flight back to JFK was not bad at all; lots of sleeping and reading and such. My parents picked me up from the airport, and I'm pretty sure I just slept for the rest of that day. My one week home was restful, and much needed.

Now I'm back in Worcester starting my 5th year at WPI as a full-time graduate student. I'm not too sure what I will be doing this year, but I'll take it as it comes. I'm still living at Theta Chi, and I've got a new room ... it doesn't have red walls but it's still nice :) Hopefully this year will be one to remember.
