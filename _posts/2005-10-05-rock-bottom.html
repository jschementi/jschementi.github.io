<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
To make this not a novel ... Friday night my computer started to act weird.  I backed up all my data to another location of the drive where it would be safe, but I didn't think to get it off my computer and onto something else like another hard drive or DVDs.  That was my mistake.  Something went wrong and I lost access to all my files.  There are still on my hard drive but I can't get to them.

I'm sending the hard drive to a data recovery company to see if they can fix it, but it's going to cost me an arm and a leg if they can recover the data.

I hope the last 7 years of my work and history are not gone ....

... moral of the story ... back up your data.  Even if it's every 6 months, do it.  Burn your stuff to DVD.  It would have only taken 8 DVDs to back up my data before I messed it up.  8 DVDs + time costs a lot less than $1000.  If you want to make your life easier, buy an external backup HD.  Just do it, cause if you don't it will happen to you.  I use to but stopped, and now look what happened.
