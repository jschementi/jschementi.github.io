<div class="post-content">
So yeah, it's been a while since I've touched this. I start work at GE on Tuesday ... ah! I wish I had more time to be home ... but oh well.

I've been working on some restaurant software for the bulk of my time home; it's pretty cool since I'm using some crazy technology. I'm working on my laptop in bed this late ... yeah, it's really been occupying my time =P ... well, that and seeing Felicia =). I've also been playing around with Linux a lot more because of this project. Enlightenment 17 is finally avaliable on CVS and damn does it look nice! Check it out at <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/">http://www.enlightenment.org</a>.

Other than that, some crazy stuff has been happening at the house ... and it amazes me how much people don't like to communicate and are willing to weasle their way around people to do things. People take the term "Brotherhood" and tie it to alterior motives outside of the helping hand. It's really sad ...

Ok, I'm tired, time to sleep!
