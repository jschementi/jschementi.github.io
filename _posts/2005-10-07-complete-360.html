OK, so I was about to go to Fedex to send my hard drive, but I just couldn't believe that this was my only option.  To cut to the chase, I got all my data back!!!  All thanks to Active@!

Active@ is a Software Company specializing in data recovery.  They make 2 tools that I used, Partition Recovery and UNDELETE, to save my files.  I really only needed UNDELETE but Partition Recovery let me see my files and give me hope that a bomb hitting my room is much worse.

Here's links to the software:

I also bought a Maxtor OneTouch II 300GB portable hard drive.  This thing is pretty sweet.  It not only a lot of storage, but it comes with Retrospect which will let you schedule backups.  It also has this button on the front of the drive that when pressed will backup and newly created/changed files.  Sweet stuff.

Anyway, now I can get on with my life ... jeesh.  That was a scare, so back up regularly ... but this was definitely a huge learning experience for me as well.

Dad and Nicole are coming to visit today, which will be nice ... good change from slaving infront of a couple of computers ...

In the mean time, I should catch up on a weeks worth of work ... weeeeee
