Doesn't Felicia look happy to be getting her picture taken? Eh, it's ok, she's still cute =).

This weekend Felicia visited me at school! Something I didn't expect, but great none-the-less. Lots of eating and sitting around watching TV; it was great to just sit around and do nothing for once =). We got DPDough one night, gosh I miss those calzones! It was really great to see her and definately was one of the better weekends.

So yeah, I'm flying out to Redmond, WA soon for my 2nd interview with Microsoft ... ah! Crazy stuff. I also went to a Career fair today and now may have a lot of other possibilities. Much better outlook than last year =).

Anywho, I've got to get back to workin', like usual. Ciao!
