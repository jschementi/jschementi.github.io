So here we are folks, Thanksgiving 2005.  I was so looking forward to taking a break from school, going home, spending time with crazy italian family, and eating alot!  But, to follow suite, that's not working out exactly as planned.  Granted, I'm home and away from school, but Thanksgiving will not be the same with just my parents, sister, and Grandmother.  My cousin and her husband and three daughters and my Aunt and Uncle will not be coming this year because of a silly feaud between them and my Grandmother.  I have to say, that's very upsetting.  The holidays should be a time for family and love, not petty fights that seperate the family on a holiday that entire family has always embraced.  I'm really bummed out about this, and it kind of puts a black cloud over this entire holiday for me.  ::sigh:: Silly silly people ...

Anyway, RENT came out in the movie theaters today ... an event I've been waiting 5 years for!  I haven't seen it yet, so don't ruin it for me, but I'm going later this week.  Hopefully people who haven't seen the show will get the same impression of it as everyone who has fallen in love with the show, and the show fans will get to experience a fresh new reincarnation.  I guess we'll see.  Also, I've been hearing it's not getting good reviews, but I kinda think that's b\c of how people review it.  For this movie, it's best to review how well the RENT story is conveyed and also how well it is represented on screen.  Reviewing the plot and character development is kinda silly since it's not a new story.

So, Happy Thanksgiving everyone!  Enjoy the company of your families and loved ones if you have that luxury ... but even if not .. we all have something to be thankful for.  Goodnight.
