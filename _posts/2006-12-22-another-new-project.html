<div class="post-content">
So, "a guy" (I'm keeping him nameless since the project is kind of hush hush for now) who worked on a school project with me, and works for himself, hired me and Pete Miller to work on upgrading their web application. Well, I looked at the Visual Basic/straight ASP code for a couple days ... and made the <span style="font-style: italic;">tough </span>decision that the current system wasn't salvageable and we need to rebuild it from scratch. What will be build it in? You guessed, Rails! So, I've been through the business mumbo-jumbo of that, and then made a prototype that "they guy" demoed in Seattle at some "we like writing styles" conference. Not bad for a couple days of work. =)

Hopefully I'll be able to speak more publicly about it soon.
