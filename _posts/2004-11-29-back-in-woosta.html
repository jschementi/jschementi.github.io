Thanksgiving break has come and gone ... not to mention a total of 14hrs travel time! AH! But the break was well deserved, needed, and enjoyable.

Thanksgiving was fun ... now that there's 3 little cousins! I'll post some of the pictures soon, along with my plate! We had it at our house, like always ... but no garduna! Very very upsetting ...

Saturday Felicia and I went to nyc for a Knicks game and an early dinner. It was kids day at Madison Square Garden, so lots of kiddy things going on during half-time. Overall it was a fun day. Also let me realize alot of things, which will hopefully make things alot easier.

I <3 facebook!

Now back in Worcester, back in school, back to work! Oh the fun.
