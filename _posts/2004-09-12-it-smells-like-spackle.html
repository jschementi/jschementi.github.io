I'm finally painting my room this week!  Weee!  Since I fixed Jenkin's computer, he's spackling my walls before I paint.  So yeah, it should be ready tomorrow for painting.  Flame! =) It's gonna look nice, finally.

Well, today was a typical WPI Saturday of homework, a short break to eat, and more homework.  I'm doing my graphics project now, trying to avoid what happened last week =(.

A full port of the Quake 2 Engine from C to Java =P  Sounds like something I'd do.  I'm poking around the source now ... probably not gonna work on my graphics hw anymore =P
