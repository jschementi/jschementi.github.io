<span xmlns=""><p>Yes, this is kind of strange … I’m making this post from Word 2007 Beta!  Right now it works with a bunch of Microsoft blogging sites, plus Blogger, and allows you to expand upon it.  Not bad.  It also has this picture upload feature, but I’m not going to test that out just yet.
</p><p>Anyway, I’ve got an article to write and a demo to practice, so I better get a move on!</p></span>
