### Professional Experience

#### [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com) - New York, NY

&raquo; **Principal Software Engineer** (8/2016 - 12/2020)
  
Principal Software Engineer at Tumblr, a blog-based social network, working on
post and content creation. Primarily built Kanvas, an open-source media editor:
[https://github.com/tumblr/kanvas-ios](https://github.com/tumblr/kanvas-ios),
and integrated it into Tumblr as a media editor, GIF maker, and story-style
posting tool. Also worked on other feature areas, like the Dashboard, Explore,
Search, and Ads, and other projects like startup performance.

Key Contributions:

- Built Tumblr media creation and editing features on iOS: camera, editing,
  GIFs, and story-style posting.
- Collaborated with Product Management to set roadmap, QA & Release Automation
  to get new features released, Product Design to make the best UX we can build, and
  Android Engineering to ensure architecture and features work similar between
  iOS and Android implementations.
- Open sourced the iOS implementation as Kanvas:
  [https://github.com/tumblr/kanvas-ios](https://github.com/tumblr/kanvas-ios),
- Prototyped a new content creation and consumption style for Tumblr.
- Built and shipped many other medium-size features across Tumblr’s backend
  systems, API, iOS, Android, and web apps, mostly focused on increasing
  engagement in posts (for example: New Posts Indicator, Note Highlights,
  Related Blogs). These features are on the Dashboard, Expore, and Search.
- Improved startup performance of Android and iOS apps over multiple projects
  (server-side database and cache workload optimizations, client-side databse
  access optimizations, and decrease data-over-the-wire).
- Advised and mentored senior engineers.
- Part of Tumblr Engineering interviewing for both Backend, Android, iOS, and
  Web roles.
- Ran a first-engineer-hire technical interview process for BUILTBYGIRLS (an
  internal team in Tumblr’s parent company’s).

#### [SOLS](http://www.sols.com) - New York, NY

&raquo; **Director of Engineering, 3D / Principal Software Engineer** (2/2015 - 6/2016)

SOLS makes custom 3D printed insoles from answering just a few questions and
taking two photos of each foot with the SOLS Custom Fit iPhone app.

As Director of Engineering 3D, I led a team of 6 engineers, responsible for
building the systems which generate the "medical" physical product and tools
to manage the process (including: automated (and manual fallback) photo
measurement, 3D model design and generation, 3D print job management).

When SOLS focused fully towards the consumer space, we flattened the team
and I focused on a new iOS app, the first version of an online purchasing
experience, and adapting our existing physical product generation system
to support a very new design of SOLS.

Key Contributions:

- Built initial version of iPhone app and services, and the final photo
  capture experience. (Swift, Node.js, and Postgres).
- Built initial online purchase experience.
- Built infrastructure automation (based on Jenkins, CloudFormation, and
  Salt Stack).
- Introduced development process with code reviews, automated testing,
  and local development environment which mimic production. Introduced
  deployment process where any developer could deploy to production after
  code review and test automation succeeded.
- Built 3D model generation system (Node.js, RabbitMQ, Python, Rhino3D,
  Blender, Amazon S3).
- Built a product tour of what the physical product would look like for
  each customer and how it was customized (Web, WebGL, Blender, Python).
