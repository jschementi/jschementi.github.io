I'm a Software Engineer in NYC ([resume](../resume))

I'm always involved in many projects, be it open-source software for the
benefit of the greater good, or technology for new business ventures.
See my [GitHub](http://github.com/jschementi) profile for all my open-source
projects. Please contact me for any questions.

## Moven

I oversee the design and engineering of <a href="http://moven.com" target="_blank">Moven</a>,
an app that helps you manage your money as you spend it.

Moven is currently invite-only, but
<a href="https://moven.com/#referral/jimmy.schementi.com" target="_blank">please request an invitation for Moven</a>
(using this link will bump you up in the queue) and get the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/moven/id661035659" target="_blank">iOS app</a>.

## Iron Languages

I am a core team member of the Iron-Languages project; the implementation of the
Ruby and Python programming language for the Microsoft.NET and Mono frameworks. I've
worked on various parts of the project, from engineering to evangelism.

## SourceAid

I've been consulting with <a target="_blank" href="http://sourceaid.com">SourceAid</a> on their <a target="_blank" href="http://cite.me">new citation management</a>
offering. I'll provide more information when they announce the first preview
release.

## ASSISTments

During my masters work at WPI, I worked at the AI Lab on <a target="_blank" href="http://assistments.org">ASSISTments</a>,
a web-based intelligent tutor. My role was more pragmatic than research oriented,
mainly on redesigning ASSISTments to the user experience and technical architecture
it has today. Though I'm no longer involved in the project, I'm happy to see the
current team continuing to do awesome work, and I strongly suggest you evaluate it
for your educational organization, your children, or even if you want to brush up
on your math skills.

## Photos

I take lots of photos between my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/cameras/nikon/d90/">Nikon D90</a> and my <a target="_blank" href="http://www.flickr.com/cameras/apple/iphone_5/">iPhone 5</a>, and post everything on <a target="_blank"  href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jschementi/">Flickr</a>. Select shots are posted to <a target="_blank" href="http://instagram.com/jschementi">Instagram</a>.
