This is my last week at GE. It's been an interesting taste of what I don't want to do with my life. Here I feel like nothing I do could possibly make a difference. I aid in the communication between people who need software and the offshore developers making it. We only have like 2 hours to talk to them, so how can it be cheaper!? The only time I feel like I made a difference is this volunteer project I organized; painting a gym!.
