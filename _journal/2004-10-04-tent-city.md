The past two weeks have been interesting to say the least. I stayed at Mike's old apartment for a night, and then stayed at Tiff and Jess's place for the next 3 nights.

But last week I woke up in a tent, on the QUAD. Yes, camping at school.

Theta Chi camped out on the QUAD to raise money for fire fighting victims. It was pretty successful ... other than the hurricane that hit and tossed all of our tents. Guess we can't live anywhere without a disaster happening.

But, it's all back to normal, back in the house and no longer sleeping in tents.
