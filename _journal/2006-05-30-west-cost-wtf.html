<p>So I'm making this post from Sammamash, WA, in my summer "corporate apartment" (which is beautiful, btw), while mooching off someone else's wireless. :) ... but ... wait ... I'm on the West Coast, WTF!!?!?!</p>

<p>The flight here was pretty cool; delta has little touchscreens in the back of the seats with music, cable tv, movies, flight gps tracking (which is the coolest thing ever), and other stuff, so i was very entertained during the flight.  I bought this really funny movie called "Hoodwinked" which is a funny interpretation of little red riding hood ... like all the new computer animated movies.  Funny stuff.  Plus, the plane was really nice and I took some nice pictures in the air :)</p>

<p>I'll also post some pictures of this place soon, just need to unpack the camera stuff :)</p>
