<p>This weekend was parents weekend, so a lot of families and fun things to do around campus. Highlight was the goat got a picture with me.

<p>Today was the beginning of Greek week, and kicking everything off was the greek olympics, complete with giant beiruit and human pyramids. We didn't do too well, but it was fun none-the-less.
