<p>I'm not going to sleep well tonight, definitely going to be up worrying. Felicia's at the emergency room because she's still dizzy.</p>

<p><strong>Update 7/29</strong>: Worrying justified. Felicia had surgery Thursday afternoon to remove a tumor and cyst at the base of her brain. She's home now and doing very well, especially for having 18 staples in her head!</p>

<p><strong>Update 8/8</strong>: I'm so happy Felicia is recovering fully. I saw her yesterday after not seeing her for a week and I was so happy she was walking. It's been a crazy 2 weeks but she's got her life back and I've got her back! Wrapping my mind around this whole thing has been really hard, but it's really made me think a lot; life is too short so make sure the people you love know you feel that way.</p>
