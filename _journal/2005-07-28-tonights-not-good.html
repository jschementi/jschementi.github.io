I'm not going to sleep well tonight, definitely going to be up worrying. Felicia's at the emergency room because she's still dizzy.

<strong>Update: </strong>worrying justified. Felicia had surgery Thursday afternoon to remove a tumor and cyst at the base of her brain. She's home now and doing very well, especially for having 18 staples in her head!
